# Worktrees and concurrent chats

Praxis gives every interactive chat on a Git repository root its own linked worktree.
Models edit there; the preview and the user's editor remain on the live checkout. The
isolation boundary is the worktree, while convergence is owned by one repository-scoped
landing queue.

All chats are peers in the rail and in the isolation model: each crosses the same
landing queue. Chat identity and worktree identity are independent; closing a
conversation does not justify retaining a stale branch.

## State model

```text
idle (detached worktree, no chat branch)
  → turn starts: attach praxis/chat-<id>
  → model edits privately
  → repository landing queue
      → success: validate, write + commit live, detach, delete chat branch
      → failure/interruption: commit partial work only on chat branch, park
      → live drift/conflict: keep cumulative work on chat branch, park

parked
  → Resolve (UI or agent tool): rebase both sides into the worktree; AI resolves markers
  → Discard: reset worktree, detach, delete chat branch
  → successful resolution: land once, detach, delete chat branch
```

The branch is a recovery reference, not the session's permanent identity. It exists
only while a turn can lose work or while a conflict awaits a decision. An idle chat
retains its worktree/session cwd but no branch, preventing stale `praxis/chat-*` refs
from growing with every chat.

## Invariants

- One live checkout has one writer. Every snapshot, landing, apply, resolve, discard,
  and teardown crosses the repository queue.
- Only a successful provider terminal outcome may auto-land. Failed or interrupted
  work stays parked and recoverable.
- A provider's duplicate terminal events finalize a turn once. In particular, Codex's
  `error` followed by `done` is one failed turn.
- A batch is validated before live writes. Complete Git conflict-marker triplets never
  cross into the live checkout.
- Three-way resolution uses a temporary index seeded from the working tree. The user's
  real staged state is not a resolver input and is never mutated.
- `.env` and non-template `.env.*`, `node_modules`, `*.tsbuildinfo`, `.praxis/`, and
  legacy `.dsgn/` are excluded from snapshots, worktree commits, and live commits.
- Parked work keeps a durable branch. Successfully landed or discarded work does not.
- Comment-created and automatic visual-edit background agents are attributed to their
  exact parent chat in the rail, but still count against the repository-wide concurrency
  cap and land through the same repository writer. Closing a parent chat does not stop
  its agent, so an agent left without a live parent re-parents onto the project's first
  chat rather than disappearing from the rail with its cancel control. Automatic edit
  completion is recorded in the activity log, not the chat transcript. The legacy
  `text-edit` event origin now covers committed props, styles, custom controls,
  and layer moves as well as text. Failed/interrupted children keep partial work
  recoverable without auto-applying it.

## What “conflict” means in Praxis

A park does not necessarily mean Git found overlapping `<<<<<<<` markers. It means the
chat's result could not be proven safe to land as one batch. Typical causes are another
chat or the user changing the same file during the turn, deletion/binary changes that
need the explicit resolver, or a failed/interrupted provider turn with partial edits.

The conflict card must therefore reflect the harness's authoritative landing state—not
the model's opinion about whether its private worktree is clean. A clean worktree can
still be parked because publication to the live checkout failed.

Codex/gateway chats can query that same authority with the session-scoped
`workspace_state` MCP tool. When it reports `parked`, `prepare_conflict_resolution`
invokes the same queued resolver as the conflict card, leaving marker-bearing files in
the chat's current worktree for the model to reconcile. The tool is idempotent after
staging, refuses to reset a worktree already edited in the current turn, and exposes no
raw Git/reset/discard escape hatch.

## Recovery and limits

On restart, dirty or unmerged orphan worktrees are folded into recovery records; work
already present live is removed. Praxis also sweeps branch-only `praxis/chat-*`
leftovers whose checkout was removed by an older or interrupted teardown. Because a
landed turn is usually a different commit on the live branch, cleanup accepts either
commit ancestry or patch equivalence against live `HEAD`; it never deletes a checked-
out branch, a persisted park, or a tip carrying a unique patch. Other namespaces such
as `backup/*`, normal work branches, and comment-agent branches are outside this sweep.

The preview currently serves the live checkout, so mid-turn worktree edits are not
visible there until landing. Isolation currently applies only when the opened folder is
the Git repository root; non-Git folders and Git subdirectories use the live path and do
not receive this concurrency guarantee.

## Publishing a shared work branch

Publish is a second repository-wide landing boundary after chat work reaches the live
checkout. The entire commit → reconcile → push → PR → merge → cleanup sequence holds a
per-repository publish lock. Before pushing an existing `praxis/*` branch, Praxis
fetches/prunes origin and records both tips below `refs/praxis/recovery/`.

The reconciliation is ancestry-driven: a remote ancestor needs only a normal push; a
local ancestor fast-forwards; true divergence gets an explicit merge commit. A push
rejected because the remote moved repeats fetch/reconciliation, with three total
attempts. Content conflicts remain in the live checkout with both recovery refs and
are surfaced as an exact file list. Publish never force-pushes, rebases, resets, or
chooses ours/theirs across the repository.

Implementation: `src/main/publish-reconcile.ts`, integrated by
`src/main/annotations.ts`. Regression coverage: `test/publish-reconcile.mjs`.
