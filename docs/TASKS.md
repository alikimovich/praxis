# TASKS

Roadmap / next steps. Tick items as you finish them and log in PROGRESS.md.

## Now / next

- [x] **Verify a real agent turn.** ✅ 2026-06-23 — `bun run verify` → AGENT-E2E OK
      (agent edited the fixture; SDK subprocess spawns fine in Electron).
- [x] **v2 first slice: click-to-select → source → chat.** ✅ 2026-06-23 — overlay
      preload, inspector, `data-dsgn-source` resolution, composer hand-off; covered by
      `test/select-element.mjs`.
- [ ] **Next:** polish / cross-file prop resolution / design-token manifests (see below).

## v4 — React Native / iOS-Simulator preview (macOS-only)

Show a booted iOS Simulator running an Expo/RN app in the right pane instead of a
web browser. Phased: mirror → interact → element-select. See
`docs/CONTEXT.md` and the 2026-06-25 PROGRESS entry.

- [x] **Phase 1 — view-only live mirror.** ✅ 2026-06-25 — detect `expo`/`react-native`
      (`previewKind: 'simulator'`), `simulator.preflight()` gates macOS+Xcode (clean card
      otherwise), `src/main/simulator.ts` boots a sim + starts Metro/launches the app + serves
      an MJPEG "sim bridge" that the existing `WebContentsView` loads as just-another-URL.
      Tests: `sim-detect`, `sim-preflight`, `sim-frame` (transport, off-macOS), `sim-e2e`
      (macOS-gated SKIP).
- [ ] **Phase 2 — interaction.** Forward tap/scroll/type from the bridge page → `idb`
      (optional dep) over a `/control` WebSocket; degrade to view-only without idb.
- [ ] **Phase 3 — element-select → RN source.** Babel `testID` stamp (the `data-dsgn-source`
      analog, `setup.ts` strategy `babel-plugin-rn`) + `idb` view-hierarchy hit-test → reuse the
      existing Inspector/`props.inspect` flow.

## v5 — multi-project workspace + agent sessions (Cursor/Conductor-style)

Today dsgn is single-everything: one open project, one preview `WebContentsView`,
one dev server, one persistent agent `query()` session. This milestone makes it a
**workspace**: open several repos at once, switch between them, and see each
project's agents — the ones working now and the ones that ran before — in a left
rail, like Cursor/Conductor. A bigger architectural lift (most single-instance
state in `main/index.ts` + `main/agent.ts` becomes per-project / per-session
maps), so phase it.

**Decisions (2026-06-25):**
- **Sequencing:** the multi-instance *main-process* slices (dev servers, agent
  sessions, preview state) overlap the files a parallel session is actively
  editing — do them **after** that work lands, not concurrently, to avoid merge
  churn. Renderer-side foundation is safe to do anytime.
- **Dev-server lifecycle:** keep inactive projects' servers **warm up to a cap N,
  then LRU-suspend** the least-recently-used (instant switch for recent projects,
  bounded memory; reload on return for evicted ones).
- **Agent sessions:** **one session per project** (not multiple-per-project) —
  each open repo gets its own agent thread + `dsgn/*` branch; the rail lists
  projects' sessions, not parallel threads within one project.
- **Svelte option C** stays deferred — option D (component-level) is the shipped
  baseline; revisit per-instance editing only with a stable Svelte API / real need.

**Foundation shipped (2026-06-25):** `projectKey` (S0) + `useWorkspace` store (S2).
See the PROGRESS entry.

- [x] **Workspace store + project identity (S0/S2).** ✅ 2026-06-25 —
      `src/shared/projectKey.ts`, `useWorkspace` in `store.ts`, live for the single
      open project. `test/project-key.mjs`, `test/chat-render.mjs`.
- [x] **Multi-instance dev servers (S7 / v5-A).** ✅ 2026-06-25 — `Map<projectKey,
      ChildProcess>` in `devserver.ts`; per-root `stop`, serialized free-port
      allocator, `stopAll` on quit. `test/devserver-multi.mjs`. (PR #19)
- [x] **One agent session per project (S8 / v5-B).** ✅ 2026-06-25 — `Map<projectKey,
      Session>` + `activeKey` in `agent.ts`; only the active session streams; new
      `agent:close-project`; closing the active clears active (no auto-promote).
      `test/agent-multi.mjs`. (PR #20)
- [x] **v5-C — multi-project visible: per-project chat + left rail.** ✅ 2026-06-26 —
      `agent:set-active` + project-tagged events (PR #23, core); per-project `useChat`
      slices with the active mirrored for back-compat; `Rail.tsx` left sidebar with
      working dots, "+ New project" (keep-warm), switching that swaps preview + chat +
      agent + tokens/annotations; warm-to-N **dev-server** LRU-suspend; dead-server
      relaunch-on-switch. `test/chat-route.mjs`, `test/rail.mjs`. (PRs #23, #24)
- [x] **v5-C2 — cap warm AGENT sessions too.** ✅ 2026-06-26 — folded into the same
      eviction: `evictWarm` (was `evictWarmServers`) now suspends the LRU projects'
      dev server **and** agent session beyond N=3, skipping the active project,
      simulators, and any mid-turn agent (`isRunningFor`). `agent:is-open` IPC +
      `applyProject` reopen-on-switch-back (awaited, "context cleared" note) mirror
      the dev-server relaunch path. TOCTOU-guarded against concurrent switch-backs.
      `test/agent-cap.mjs`. Context resume itself is v5-D.
- [ ] **Previous + working agents (history).** Persist finished sessions
      (transcript, the branch/PR they produced, files touched) so "previous agents"
      are reopenable to review or resume — not just the live ones. Surface them
      under each project in the rail with status dots.
- [ ] **Rail UI.** Left sidebar: repos → sessions, status indicators, new-agent,
      and a way to jump to a session's preview + chat. Mirrors the attached
      Cursor-style layout.

## v7 — multi-provider model backends  ⭐ NEW (2026-06-26, user-requested; explore-then-build)

Add support for non-Claude backends: **OpenAI / ChatGPT SDK, Vercel v0, Google Gemini,
xAI Grok**. Explore feasibility first, then build what's possible.

**Architectural tension to resolve in the spike:** dsgn's agent core is the **Claude Agent
SDK** (locked decision) precisely because it provides *in-process tools* wired to the
renderer (select→edit props→annotate→PR) plus repo `CLAUDE.md`/skills — the product
differentiator. Generic LLM APIs (OpenAI/Gemini/Grok) don't ship an equivalent agent loop
with file-editing tools; **v0** is a code-generation API, not a tool-using chat agent. So
"support" likely means a **provider abstraction with an agent loop we own**. The natural
unifier is the **Vercel AI SDK** (`generateText`/`streamText` + tools across
`@ai-sdk/openai`, `@ai-sdk/google`, `@ai-sdk/xai`, `@ai-sdk/anthropic`) — which also pairs
with the AI Elements UI we just adopted. Trade-off: an AI-SDK agent loop must re-implement
the file-edit/permission/skill tooling the Claude Agent SDK gives for free.

- [x] **Spike (explore).** ✅ 2026-06-26 — `docs/v7-multi-provider-design.md`. Conclusions:
      **OpenAI / Gemini / Grok** are all viable as ONE uniform agent loop via the **Vercel AI
      SDK** (`streamText`+`stopWhen`), behind a `ModelProvider` seam that emits the same
      `AgentEvent`s as today (the existing `Session` interface is ~90% of it). **v0 is
      generation-only — NOT a chat backend** (wire later as a discrete `/generate` action).
      Two big strings attached: (1) **auth shifts** from Claude OAuth-subscription to
      **BYO per-provider API key** (safeStorage) + per-token billing; (2) non-Claude backends
      **lose skills + CLAUDE.md auto-apply + slash-commands** (Claude-Agent-SDK-only) and must
      re-implement the hardened tool suite + permission loop (~6–8 days, security-sensitive).
- [x] **AUTH DECISION (user, 2026-06-26): subscription login, NOT BYO API key.** This
      flips the architecture — see the REVISED section in `docs/v7-multi-provider-design.md`.
      Wrap each vendor's **subscription-auth coding-agent SDK/CLI** (Codex SDK, Gemini CLI,
      Grok Build CLI), NOT the Vercel AI SDK. All three have subscription OAuth + headless
      event streams in 2026, and **bring their own tools** — so the ~6–8 day tool-suite
      rebuild drops to a per-provider adapter. No keys, no billing, no `safeStorage` UI.
- [x] **Seam + Codex scaffold (items 1–4).** ✅ 2026-06-26 — `src/main/backends/`:
      `types.ts` (`ModelProvider`/`ProviderSession`/`PendingPrompt`), `tools.ts` (shared tool
      policy, no cycle), `claude.ts` (incumbent extracted verbatim behind the seam),
      `codex.ts` (EXPERIMENTAL `@openai/codex-sdk`, lazy non-literal import, fails soft),
      `index.ts` (`pickProvider`). `agent.ts` slimmed to backend-agnostic session mgmt;
      `AgentOptions.provider`. **Claude path byte-identical — full `verify` + AGENT-E2E green
      through the indirection.** `test/provider-seam.mjs` (creds-free). (commit 8f2bd71)
- [ ] **Make Codex real:** `bun add @openai/codex-sdk`, the user runs `codex login`, then
      verify a live Codex turn edits a fixture; confirm/fix the `codex.ts` event mapping
      against the real streamed events; map Codex tool approvals → permission cards.
- [ ] **UI:** a provider picker in the composer toolbar (alongside model/effort), passing
      `provider` through `toAgentOptions`/`openProject`; a per-provider "login needed" banner
      reusing `isAuthError`.
- [ ] **Then:** Gemini CLI provider (subprocess, `--output-format stream-json` JSONL →
      `AgentEvent`), then Grok Build CLI.
- [ ] **Minor open calls:** which provider after Codex (rec: Gemini); each agent uses its own
      conventions file (Codex `AGENTS.md`, Gemini `GEMINI.md`) — skills stay Claude-only;
      v0 `/generate` action (separate workstream) — build only if wanted.

## v6 — Tailwind + shadcn chat UI (AI Elements)  ⭐ (2026-06-26, user-requested)

Migrate the **chat panel** fully to **Tailwind + shadcn/ui**, using **AI Elements**
(`elements.ai-sdk.dev`) and shadcn's chat primitives. **Priority rule per feature:**
first-party shadcn **primitive** if one fits → else **AI Elements** component → else
**custom** with shadcn+Tailwind. Components are driven by the existing `useChat` zustand
store + `agent:*` IPC (NOT the Vercel AI SDK runtime).

**Decision reversal:** overturns the locked "Plain CSS, no Tailwind / no UI kit"
(`docs/CONTEXT.md`) — the exact scaffolding that got assistant-ui deferred. Accepted by
the user (2026-06-26). Tailwind coexists with the existing plain CSS (chat first).

**Hard constraint:** preserve test-facing hooks so the ~30-test verify suite stays green —
`.composer__input` (readiness selector across ~20 tests), `.markdown`, `.slash__item`,
`.perm*`, and the `aria-label` selects (Model / Thinking level / Permission mode). Scope =
`ChatPanel.tsx` + in-panel components (Inspector, PermissionCards, NotesPanel, SetupCard,
TokenOfferCard, Markdown). App-header branch pill + auth banner are separate chrome.

- [ ] **Scaffold Tailwind + shadcn** in the electron-vite renderer (coexist with
      `styles.css`; `components.json`, `cn()`, `@/*` alias, bun CLI). Confirm AI Elements
      runs without the Vercel AI SDK (driven by our store) — build + typecheck green.
- [ ] **Rebuild ChatPanel** on shadcn primitives / AI Elements per the priority rule,
      preserving every feature (streaming, tool-status, slash menu, model/effort/permission
      pickers, auth banner, permission cards, inspector hand-off, per-project routing) and
      the test hooks above.
- [ ] **Re-verify** `chat-render` / `chat-route` (+ smoke and the rest), screenshot the new
      panel into `test/artifacts/`.
- [ ] **Element-inspector surfaces → shadcn (follow-up pass).** Inspector.tsx,
      NotesPanel.tsx, TokenPalette.tsx are dense element-editing UIs (appear only on
      element-select, distinct from the chat conversation) with many test hooks
      (`.inspector__ask/__link/__source/__tag/__noteinput/__notesave/__ready--no`,
      `.notes__item/__remove/__text`, `.tokens/__item/__swatch`). Convert to shadcn
      Card/Collapsible/Badge/Button in a focused pass, preserving every hook
      (annotations, ready-gating, select-element, prop-edit, tokens tests).
- [ ] **Stretch:** evaluate other AI Elements (Sources, Task, Chain-of-Thought, Web
      Preview, Reasoning) for dsgn's flows.
- [ ] **Optional: test modernization.** Add `data-testid`s and migrate smoke/
      chat-render off volatile BEM classes; then the three pickers can become shadcn
      `Select` (currently native, locked by the `$$eval('option')` permission-mode assertion).

## v2 — design-system-aware select & edit (the differentiator)

- [x] Inject a preload into the preview `WebContentsView` with a click-to-select overlay.
      (`src/preview/preload.ts` — shadow-DOM highlight + pick.)
- [x] Map selected DOM → source location via the `data-dsgn-source` stamp
      (nearest-ancestor resolution; CSS-selector fallback). See `docs/DESIGN.md`.
- [x] `react-docgen` prop schemas. ✅ 2026-06-23 — `src/main/props.ts` parses the source
      file at the stamp line and runs react-docgen for the component's prop types/enums.
- [x] `DESIGN.md` convention started — `data-dsgn-source` stamping + a reference Vite/Babel
      plugin documented. (Full open-design 9-section schema is still future work.)
- [x] **Prop/token editor panel.** ✅ 2026-06-23 — typed controls in the inspector
      (string/number/boolean/enum); **hybrid apply**: simple literals are spliced straight
      into source (instant hot-reload), complex values fall back to the agent. Covered by
      `test/prop-edit.mjs`.
  - [x] Cross-file component resolution. ✅ 2026-06-23 — follows the component's relative
        import to its definition file and runs react-docgen there (matches the exported name;
        barrel re-exports can't mis-attach).
  - [x] **Design tokens.** ✅ 2026-06-23 — `src/main/tokens.ts` auto-detects the source per
        project (`.dsgn/tokens.json` manifest → `tailwind.config.*` static parse → CSS custom
        properties) and the inspector shows a token palette; clicking a token applies it via
        the agent.
  - [ ] **Direct (agent-free) prop editing — make it the default & broaden it.** ⭐ NEW
        (2026-06-26, user-requested; backlog). React first, then other frameworks. *Current
        state:* `props.apply` already splices **literal** string/number/boolean/enum edits
        straight into source (instant hot-reload, **no agent, no chat message**); only
        non-literal/complex values fall back to a seeded chat prompt (`needsAgent`). *Goal:*
        shrink the agent fallback — (a) **token clicks apply directly** when the target maps
        to a literal class/style/prop, (b) widen literal coverage, (c) make "applied directly"
        the visible default with a rare, clear "needs agent" path, (d) confirm hot-reload
        fires after a splice. Extend `test/prop-edit.mjs`; then carry to Svelte/others.

## v3 — engineer handoff

- [x] Annotations stored in a repo sidecar (`.dsgn/annotations.json`). ✅ 2026-06-23 —
      `src/main/annotations.ts`; the agent is denied writes under `.dsgn/` (agent.ts guard).
      Rendered as numbered pins over the preview (`src/preview/preload.ts`) + a notes panel.
- [x] **Publish → branch + GitHub PR.** ✅ 2026-06-23 — `publishToPr` creates a branch,
      commits, pushes, and `gh pr create`s with a generated body (notes + changed files).
      Covered by `test/annotations.mjs` (storage + UI); the live `gh` path is user-triggered.

## Editing readiness (built)

- [x] **Gate prop editing on dsgn-readiness.** ✅ 2026-06-23 — only schema-backed components
      are editable (`hasSchema`); unready ones are prompt-only.
- [x] **Floating prop panel** on the preview's right edge (reserves a strip; native view can't
      be floated over). ✅ 2026-06-23.
- [x] **On-open setup offer** — detects unstamped projects and offers to scaffold the stamping
      plugin + agent-type the components. ✅ 2026-06-23.
- [x] **Framework-aware setup** — detect the UI framework from `package.json` deps BEFORE
      generating anything, emit the right instrumentation into `.dsgn/` (React/Solid Babel plugin,
      Svelte markup preprocessor; Vue→inspector, unknown→nothing), send framework-correct agent
      instructions, verify stamps actually fired, and offer `setup:uninstall`. ✅ 2026-06-24 —
      `src/main/setup.ts`, `test/setup-detect.mjs`.
- [x] **Inline text editing.** ✅ 2026-06-24 — double-click a stamped text-only element in the
      preview to edit its text in place; writes straight to source (`applyTextEdit`), agent
      fallback for expression/mixed/Svelte content. (`test/text-edit.mjs`.)
- [x] **Auto-restart the preview after setup** so the wired-in config applies without a manual
      reload; the post-restart readiness report is the verdict. ✅ 2026-06-24 — `App.restartPreview`,
      `test/setup-restart.mjs`.
- [x] **Svelte inline text-splice** — rewrite a plain-text `.svelte` element's content directly in
      source (svelte/compiler), agent-fallback for expression/mixed. ✅ 2026-06-24 —
      `applySvelteTextEdit` in props-svelte.ts, `test/text-edit-svelte.mjs`.
- [x] **First-run `.dsgn/tokens.json` offer** — when a project has no tokens at all, offer a
      starter manifest (deterministic write; never shadows Tailwind/CSS or clobbers a manifest).
      ✅ 2026-06-24 — `scaffoldManifest` in tokens.ts, `TokenOfferCard`, `test/tokens-scaffold.mjs`.
- [x] **Svelte component prop schema reachable (option D).** A host element inside a component
      definition surfaces that file's own props (no DOM node carries the usage stamp); edits route
      to the agent as a default change. ✅ 2026-06-25 — `inspectSvelteProps`, `test/prop-svelte-self.mjs`.
- [x] **Figma-style inline modes** — C: comment-to-agent, Y: annotation. Inline composer in the
      preview overlay anchored to the clicked element; comment → agent, annotation → pin. ✅
      2026-06-25 — `src/preview/preload.ts`, `App.tsx`, `test/comment-mode.mjs`.
- [ ] **Svelte per-instance prop editing (option C).** Map a clicked DOM node → its owning Svelte 5
      component instance → the usage location, for true per-instance edits across all component shapes.
      **Deferred (2026-06-25):** needs Svelte-5 dev internals with no stable public API (fragile);
      option D (component-level) is the baseline. Revisit only with a stable API / concrete need.

## Polish (anytime)

- [x] First-run auth onboarding panel — auth-error detection (`isAuthError`) → amber
      guidance banner pointing at `claude setup-token`. (`08-auth-onboarding.png`.)
- [x] **Permission approve/deny cards.** ✅ 2026-06-23 — `canUseTool` now surfaces an
      approve/deny card per gated tool and awaits the user (read-only tools auto-allowed so
      Ask mode stays usable). A toolbar selector sets the SDK permission mode:
      **Ask (`default`) · Auto-accept edits (`acceptEdits`) · Auto: approve all
      (`bypassPermissions`)** — "Auto" is real SDK bypass via `query.setPermissionMode`, and
      the mode is also passed at project-open so it persists. This is the backstop for the
      v2 select→prompt injection surface.
- [ ] Live thinking-level changes — **blocked**: the SDK `Query` has `setModel` but no
      live effort setter, so changing it mid-session would require restarting the
      session (losing history). Applied at project-open for now.
- [ ] Revisit assistant-ui once v2 UI needs grow (store seam is ready).
