# PROGRESS LOG

Newest first. Append a dated entry when you finish a chunk of work.

## 2026-06-23 — Logging, cross-machine handoff, self-testing

- Added `CLAUDE.md` + `docs/{CONTEXT,PROGRESS,TASKS}.md` so progress/context/tasks
  live in-repo and travel via git (continue on any machine after `git pull`).
- Added `test/agent-e2e.mjs`: a REAL Claude turn that opens an editable fixture,
  asks the agent to change a heading, and asserts the file changed. SKIPs without
  auth, FAILs if the turn ran but didn't edit. Added `bun run verify`.
- ✅ Ran `bun run verify` with credentials present: **AGENT-E2E OK** — the agent
  edited the fixture via a live turn. Confirms end-to-end agent works and the SDK
  CLI subprocess spawns correctly inside Electron (prior runtime risk resolved).

## 2026-06-23 — Adversarial review fixes

- Ran a multi-agent review workflow (15 verified findings); fixed: session
  epoch-guard (no stale events across project switches), composer-stuck-on-switch,
  `sandbox:true` on main + preview windows, preview hardening (window-open handler +
  will-navigate origin pin + validate `preview:load` is local http(s)), per-outage
  retry reset, resize-drag release on blur/visibilitychange, `/` menu Escape re-arm,
  CSP `object-src`/`base-uri`.

## 2026-06-22/23 — Chat upgrade + controls + UX

- Markdown rendering (react-markdown + remark-gfm + rehype-highlight, hand-written
  hljs theme, plain CSS).
- Composer toolbar: model picker (live `setModel`), thinking/effort selector,
  `/` skill menu from the SDK init `slash_commands`.
- Drag-to-resize split (hides native preview during drag). Custom dev-command
  escape hatch on launch failure; Reload/Stop controls.

## 2026-06-22 — Real Agent SDK chat

- Wired `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` (ESM, dynamic import): persistent
  multi-turn `query()`, cwd=repo, `settingSources` + `claude_code` preset,
  streaming deltas + tool status over IPC, `canUseTool` auto-approve.
- Fixed ESM-in-CJS crash; preview readiness polling + retry for `ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE`;
  dev-server ownership + cleanup-on-quit + conflict errors.

## 2026-06-22 — Scaffold + preview + tests

- electron-vite + React + TS shell; two-pane layout; native `WebContentsView`
  preview with IPC geometry sync; typed `window.api`; dev-server runner
  (detect/spawn/parse/readiness). Playwright+Electron smoke + open→preview tests.
- Made dsgn its own git repo (was an untracked subdir of `~/.git`).
