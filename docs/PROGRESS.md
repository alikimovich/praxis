## 2026-07-04 — Preview self-heals when its dev server dies and comes back

- A dev server that dies mid-session (crash, external kill) left the preview
  permanently on Chromium's error page (black in dark mode): the HMR client
  reloads when its websocket drops, the load fails with CONNECTION_REFUSED, and
  the old retry budget (40 × 400ms ≈ 16s) ran out long before any restart —
  nothing ever re-navigated the view. Discovered the hard way: a session's
  lkmv.ch server was killed out from under a live preview (mistaken for a test
  leak), and the pane stayed black even after the server came back.
- Fix: `did-fail-load` no longer gives up after the budget — past 40 fast
  retries it settles into a slow 3s poll for as long as a previewUrl is set.
  Idle/placeholder views never poll (the handler only fires for the current
  previewUrl). Budget still resets on successful load.
- Verified with a live scenario: open fixture → kill its server + reload →
  error page for 25s (budget exhausted) → start replacement server on the same
  port → preview recovers within ~3s, no project reopen. Smoke, open-preview,
  ready-gating green.

## 2026-07-06 — Prop panel always-on (floating ⇄ docked); strip cleanup

- The PropPanel opens for EVERY selection now, not just schema-backed ones: a
  resolved schema shows the editable fields as before; otherwise the panel
  hosts the readiness message that used to sit in the composer strip (setup
  link for unstamped elements — .proppanel__link; owner jump —
  .proppanel__owner; prompt-only hint). Default layout is a FLOATING card at
  the preview's top right (auto height, max 65vh); a header toggle docks it as
  the full-height right sidebar. Mode persists (usePropPanelMode →
  localStorage). Both modes reserve the same native-preview inset strip — the
  native view always paints above DOM, floating "over" it is impossible.
- Composer strip: now a single aligned row (pill + source), the "No editable
  props…" hint removed (it lives in the panel).
- Composer placeholder: "Ask Praxis  (/ for skills)".
- Mobile viewport: scrollbars hidden inside the bezel (injected style with the
  frame) — phones don't show persistent scrollbars.
- Tests: ready-gating asserts the panel's readiness classes (the old "panel
  must NOT open for no-schema" flipped by design); select-element owner jump →
  .proppanel__owner.

## 2026-07-06 — In-preview selection toolbar; editable URL bar; device toggle

- The element actions moved from the composer strip into a floating toolbar
  ADJACENT to the selection inside the preview (preload-drawn, in the overlay's
  shadow tree): comment/annotate open the in-page composer directly on the
  element (composeKind now decouples an open composer from the armed mode);
  code/delete relay to the renderer over `dsgn:preview:toolbar-action`. The
  toolbar tracks scroll/resize, hides on HMR-detach, mode arming, select-off,
  and on the new `preview:clear-selected` (renderer drops selection → pill ×,
  send, delete). The composer strip keeps pill + source + readiness hint only.
- Preview bar: the URL is now shown in full and the part after the origin is
  editable in place (Enter navigates via preview.load — still guarded to
  localhost; Escape reverts). New `preview:url-changed` relay (did-navigate +
  did-navigate-in-page) keeps it tracking SPA routes/link clicks. Desktop/Mobile
  segmented control replaced with a single Figma-style MonitorSmartphone icon
  toggle (⌘1/⌘2 + Actions menu unchanged).
- Composer bottom row: select button sized to match the backend/model selects
  (`.iconbtn--sm`).
- Tests: select-element asserts the toolbar (all four actions) inside the
  preview page and that it hides when the pill clears; annotations drives the
  engine directly (UI path covered by comment-mode); code-drawer/code-peek open
  the drawer via its store; viewport-per-project is PORT-AGNOSTIC now (a live
  app session on 7777 must not fail the suite — reads the URL from the bar).

## 2026-07-06 — Floating props island above the preview; persistent selection

- The floating prop panel now paints ON TOP of the live preview content. DOM
  can't do that (the native view always wins), so the island is a second
  WebContentsView stacked above the preview, booting the same renderer bundle
  with ?dsgnPanel=1 (renders just PropPanel on a transparent background). The
  main renderer (PanelHost) drives bounds/state over panel:* IPC, handles its
  actions, resizes to reported content height, and hides it under freeze
  overlays. Docked mode is unchanged: in-DOM sidebar + reserved preview inset.
  PropPanel gained variant='overlay'|'docked' + onToggleDock; the mode persists
  (usePropPanelMode). Tests asserting panel DOM dock it first
  (__dsgnPropPanelMode).
- Selection stays highlighted while hovering other elements: the preload keeps
  a dedicated selection layer — outlines on every element sharing the picked
  element's data-dsgn-source (loop/component instances) with an "h3 × 4" badge,
  independent of the hover box. Cleared with the toolbar (pill ×, send, mode
  arm, select-off); tracks scroll/resize/HMR relayout on the pin cadence.

## 2026-07-06 — Selection UX: composer pill + element actions (Figma Make-style)

- Preview bar's three mode buttons (select/comment/annotate) are gone. Element
  select now lives in the composer's bottom row (like Figma Make's Edit) — the
  button drives App's toggle through a new `useUiActions` registry store, so the
  simulator-vs-web routing stays in one place. S/C/Y shortcuts + the native menu
  item unchanged.
- Selecting an element puts a removable PILL in the composer (tag + ident + ×)
  with element-scoped actions beside it: Comment (detached parallel agent, same
  spawn flow as preview C-mode), Annotate (pin a note, no agent), Show code
  (editor drawer), Delete (agent turn). Comment/annotate share one inline
  textarea in the strip.
- The "Ask dsgn…" button and its visible "In the preview I selected the <p…>
  element (selector: …)" seeding are REMOVED: the element reference now rides
  along invisibly — ChatPanel's send() prepends `describeSelectionForPrompt` to
  the prompt for the model while the transcript shows only the user's words.
  The pill is consumed on send. Delete shows a short "Delete the <tag> element"
  user message with the same hidden context.
- Inspector.tsx rewritten as the strip (kept class names tests rely on:
  inspector__tag/__source/__ready/__link/__owner/__noteinput/__notesave/
  __codebtn). Tests updated: select-element (pill + clean composer instead of
  seeded text), annotations (Annotate icon instead of "Note" text button),
  comment-mode (arms via store — the same path as the C/Y shortcuts).

## 2026-07-04 — Preview corners: native setBorderRadius, corner-mask hack removed

- The desktop preview's bottom corners looked DOUBLED: the in-page corner masks
  (injected divs painting arcs over the previewed app) keyed their colors off
  `nativeTheme` (the OS appearance), but the app UI renders light regardless —
  on a dark-mode OS the masks painted `#111113`/`#2a2a2e` next to the card's
  light corner, drawing a second corner. Any color/geometry disagreement in
  that scheme doubles the corner by construction.
- Fix: deleted the whole mask path (main's `cornerRadius`/`cornerOpts`/
  `preview:set-corners` IPC + theme repaint, preload's `setCorners` injector,
  `api.setCorners`) and instead pass `radius: DESKTOP_CORNER_RADIUS` through
  `preview:set-bounds` → the existing native `view.setBorderRadius()` (the same
  path mobile's iPhone-screen rounding already used). All four corners round;
  the top ones show as a subtle inset under the card header — content-in-a-
  rounded-panel look, consistent with the bottom. Captures are square content
  now (no baked-in masks), and the freeze `<img>` radius matches.
- PR #63 was reverted wholesale first (its corner decisions were suspect), then
  its two still-valid fixes were re-applied on top of the new scheme: buildPins
  skips materializing the overlay host when there are no pins, and
  `preview:reset` zeroes frame/pins state (cornerRadius no longer exists).
- Verified: repro harness captured the composited window (screencapture of the
  window rect — the native view never shows in renderer screenshots) before/
  after; before shows the dark mask arc + square corner, after a single clean
  rounding. typecheck + smoke, open-preview, mobile-frame, viewport-per-project,
  select-element, annotations, comment-mode, ready-gating all green.
- Gotcha hit while testing: a leaked `vite dev --port 7777` from a previous app
  session made viewport-per-project time out (fixture landed on 7778). Check
  `lsof -iTCP:7777` before blaming a test.

## 2026-07-03 — LKM-20: Code opens the editor drawer; unified code colors

- **"Code" now opens the editor drawer directly** (right, under the preview) instead
  of an inline read-only peek in the left inspector. The Inspector's Code button
  toggles `useCodeDrawer` on the selected element's source; `CodePeek.tsx` is deleted
  (its `source:read` / `source:open-in-editor` engine in `props.ts` is unchanged and now
  drives the drawer).
- **Drawer gains the peek's affordances:** an **Editor** button (`source:open-in-editor`
  → the user's own editor) and an **Expand** toggle that grows the drawer while keeping a
  ~160px live-preview strip (measures its `.previewcard__body` container via
  ResizeObserver; grows the `usePanelInset.bottom` it reserves).
- **Unified colors:** the CodeMirror drawer is themed from the app's `--background`/
  `--foreground`/`--muted` tokens (so it matches the surrounding surfaces and flips with
  light/dark) with a `HighlightStyle` matched 1:1 to the styles.css highlight.js palette
  the markdown code blocks use. Previously the drawer used CodeMirror's default theme,
  which didn't match the (light) peek — the reported mismatch.
- Tests: `test/code-peek.mjs` UI section now asserts the Code button opens the drawer
  (no `.codepeek`) with Editor + Expand controls; `test/code-drawer.mjs` opens via the
  Code button (dropped the peek→Edit two-step). Both green; typecheck green.

## 2026-07-03 — Dock icon size fix: ship the layered (Assets.car) icon

- The dock icon rendered ~10% larger than neighboring apps. Cause: the iOS
  Icon Composer export is full-bleed (opaque edge-to-edge, no margins), and a
  legacy flat .icns is drawn at its canvas scale, while macOS 26 gives native
  layered icons the standard sizing treatment.
- Fix, two parts:
  - Compiled `dsgn.icon` (Icon Composer source in ~/Downloads/app-icon) with
    `xcrun actool --app-icon dsgn --platform macosx` → `build/Assets.car` +
    small-size renditions. `scripts/patch-electron.mjs` now also installs
    Assets.car into the dev Electron.app and sets `CFBundleIconName=dsgn`, so
    Tahoe renders the true layered icon (with dark/tinted variants).
  - Rebuilt `build/icon.png`/`icon.icns` on the macOS grid: plate scaled to
    204/256 of the canvas + transparent margins + soft shadow (geometry measured
    from actool's own 256px render; 512/1024 synthesized from the 1024 iOS
    export with sharp, small sizes taken from actool's output).
- Removed `app.dock.setIcon()` — runtime dock images skip the system icon
  treatment; the bundle's icon (patched in by postinstall) is the right path.
- Verified via `NSRunningApplication.icon` (what the Dock shows for a running
  app): our plate is 206×206@(25,25) in 256 — pixel-identical geometry to
  Music.app. Typecheck + smoke green.

## 2026-07-03 — Real app icon + dev Electron.app rebrand

- **Real icon artwork**: replaced the placeholder `build/icon.png` with the
  pixel-cat icon from the design's Icon Composer exports
  (`Icon-iOS-Default-1024x1024@1x.png`); generated `build/icon.icns` from it
  (sips + iconutil, all sizes). Deleted `scripts/make-placeholder-icon.mjs`.
- **Dev menu bar said "Electron"**: on macOS the app-menu title, Cmd-Tab entry,
  and Activity Monitor name come from Electron.app's own Info.plist —
  `app.setName()` cannot change them in dev. Since dsgn ships as source and runs
  via `bun run dev`, added `scripts/patch-electron.mjs` (postinstall): sets
  CFBundleName/CFBundleDisplayName to Praxis in
  `node_modules/electron/dist/Electron.app`, swaps `electron.icns` for ours, and
  ad-hoc re-signs the bundle (editing a signed bundle breaks its seal; unsigned
  apps get killed on arm64). Idempotent; darwin-only; re-runs on every install
  since `bun install` restores stock Electron. Bundle id stays
  `com.github.Electron` on purpose — changing it would reset TCC permission
  grants (screen recording etc.) for the dev app.
- Verified: typecheck + smoke green after the re-sign; live launch shows
  LSDisplayName "Praxis" and a menu-bar screenshot confirms the app menu reads
  Praxis.

## 2026-07-03 — Branding + File menu (Praxis)

- Renamed the app Electron → **Praxis**: `app.setName('Praxis')` at main module
  load (drives the macOS app-menu label + About panel), window `title`, renderer
  `<title>`, and `productName` in package.json (for eventual packaging).
- **App icon**: `build/icon.png` loaded via `nativeImage`; set as the dev dock
  icon (`app.dock.setIcon`, macOS) and the `BrowserWindow` `icon` (Win/Linux),
  both guarded on `!isEmpty()` so a missing file degrades gracefully. NOTE: the
  committed PNG is a generated placeholder (`scripts/make-placeholder-icon.mjs`) —
  the real artwork from the design's app-icon.zip couldn't be fetched in the
  sandboxed runner (no network); drop it in at `build/icon.png` to replace it.
- **File menu**: new top-level File menu with New Project (Cmd+N) / Open Project
  (Cmd+O) — moved out of the Actions menu — plus **Open Recent**, a submenu of up
  to 8 recents + Clear Menu. Recents live in the renderer store (localStorage); it
  pushes them to main over `menu:set-recents`, main rebuilds the native submenu,
  and a chosen recent comes back over `menu:open-recent` (reopens keeping the
  current project warm). `test/menu-recents.mjs` asserts the rename + menu.
  (Playwright's Electron launch can't complete its handshake in this worktree
  runner — the pre-existing smoke test times out identically — but the built main
  boots and runs without crashing; typecheck + build are green.)

## 2026-07-03 — Dev-mode Chrome DevTools (CDP endpoint)

`bun run dev` now passes `--remote-debugging-port` (9222; `DSGN_DEBUG_PORT`
overrides), gated on `ELECTRON_RENDERER_URL` so a built/packaged app never opens
it. Real Chrome attaches full DevTools (Elements/Console/Network/Sources/
Performance) to both the chat window and the preview `WebContentsView` via
`chrome://inspect`. Verified live: dev app answers `:9222/json` (~5s after
launch); built app booted and the port stayed closed across 10s of retries;
full `bun run verify` green. Nuance: the preview target only appears after a
project is open (`ensurePreviewView` is lazy — first `preview:set-bounds`).
Gotcha + Chrome 111+ `remote-allow-origins` note added to CONTEXT.md.

## 2026-07-02 — v9 Phase 2: editable code drawer (user-requested)

Finished the in-tool code view — Phase 1 let you *look* at the inspected element's
source; Phase 2 lets you *edit* it without leaving dsgn. A CodeMirror 6 drawer
docks under the preview; saving routes through the same `commitEdit` seam as every
other direct edit, so undo/redo, on-disk conflict detection, and HMR all come free.

Also **cleaned up `docs/TASKS.md`** first (user request): shipped milestones (v2–v8)
moved to a new `docs/TASKS-archive.md`; the open v7 (multi-provider), v6 leftovers,
deferred Svelte, and blocked polish items were **dropped** and recorded in the
archive's "Dropped" section so they aren't silently forgotten. TASKS.md is now just v9.

- **Geometry** (`PreviewPane.tsx` + `usePanelInset`): a DOM panel can't float over
  the native `WebContentsView`, so the drawer reserves space instead. `usePanelInset`
  gained a `bottom` value alongside the existing right-edge `inset` (PropPanel); the
  pane now shrinks the native view's HEIGHT by `bottom` (`availH`), and the drawer —
  absolutely positioned at the bottom of `previewcard__body` — fills the freed strip.
  Both desktop and mobile (bezel) paths honor it.
- **Save seam** (`props.ts`): `source:write(root, source, baseline, content)` →
  refuses if the on-disk content drifted from the `baseline` the drawer loaded
  (conflict, same contract as undo/redo), else `commitEdit` (write + history entry).
  `SourceWriteResult` in `shared/api.ts`; preload + IPC wired.
- **UI**: `CodeDrawer.tsx` — CM6 built imperatively (`basicSetup` + lang-javascript/
  html/css, light default highlight to match the app), the stamp's line span marked
  via a mapped `StateField` decoration (`.cm-stamp-line`), scrolled to the element,
  `⌘S`/Save (dirty-gated) → `source:write`, conflict banner with Reload, close
  releases the inset. Opened from a new "Edit" ⤢ button in the `CodePeek` header;
  `useCodeDrawer` store holds the open source; closes on project switch (stale-root
  guard).
- **Dep**: added `codemirror` + `@codemirror/lang-{javascript,html,css}` (renderer is
  ESM). Trialed `@codemirror/theme-one-dark` but removed it — basicSetup's light
  default highlight fits the light app better.
- **Test**: `test/code-drawer.mjs` — engine (conflict guard, whole-file save writes +
  records undo, second stale save re-conflicts, `edits.undo` reverts) + UI (peek
  "Edit" → CM mounts, stamp highlighted, bottom inset reserved, close releases it);
  mutates the fixture then restores it. In `test`/`verify` as `test:codedrawer`;
  screenshot `13-code-drawer.png`. Full `verify` green (one unrelated flake: a stale
  node process holding port 7777 failed `viewport-per-project` until killed).
- **Known limit**: with the floating PropPanel (right strip) also open, it overlaps
  the drawer's top-right in a narrow window — the two insets are mutually unaware.

## 2026-07-03 — Inspector code peek + "open in editor" (user-requested)

The user kept alt-tabbing to an editor just to *look at* the code of the element
they were inspecting. Phase 1 of the in-tool code view: a read-only, syntax-
highlighted peek of the stamped source file right in the Inspector, plus a
one-click jump to the user's real editor. (Phase 2 — an editable CodeMirror
drawer under the preview with saves routed through `commitEdit` — is on TASKS.)

- **Engine** (`props.ts`): `source:read` IPC → `SourceView` (`shared/api.ts`):
  the whole file (context stays visible) + the stamp line + the element's full
  open→close **line span**, resolved by the same `findElementAtLine` +
  enclosing-`JSXElement` walk `applyTextEdit` uses. Svelte/unparsable files fall
  back to the stamp line alone. `resolveSource` keeps root-escape stamps out.
- **Open in editor** (`source:open-in-editor`): tries `code -g`/`cursor -g`/
  `zed`/`subl` with a `file:line:col` jump target (a missing CLI ENOENTs fast →
  next), then falls back to `shell.openPath` (OS default app, no jump). Fails
  soft with a message — never throws at the renderer.
- **UI**: `CodePeek.tsx` — a "Code" toggle in the Inspector's action row reveals
  the file: highlight.js (new direct dep; already in the tree via
  rehype-highlight, and it reuses the existing `.hljs-*` theme in styles.css),
  a line-number gutter, the element's span marked with a bar, auto-scrolled so
  the stamp sits a third down the viewport. Header shows `path:line` + an
  "Editor" jump button. Fixed 18px line height keeps the gutter/mark/scroll
  math honest; the whole-file render is one `<code>` block (no per-line hljs
  splitting, which breaks on multi-line tokens) with the span drawn as an
  absolutely-positioned bar behind the text.
- **Test**: `test/code-peek.mjs` — engine (file + spans incl. a new multi-line
  fixture element, root-escape refused, openInEditor soft-fail) + UI (toggle →
  highlighted peek, gutter, `data-stamp-line`, auto-scroll) + screenshot
  `12-code-peek.png`. In `test`/`verify` chains as `test:codepeek`.
- **Caveat**: developed in a sandboxed environment where the Electron binary
  can't download (GitHub releases blocked) — `typecheck`, `build`, and all pure
  bun tests are green here; run `bun run verify` locally to exercise the
  Electron suite including the new test.
## 2026-07-02 — provider-seam: don't depend on real CLIs being absent

`test/provider-seam.mjs` asserted the codex/gemini backends fail soft "when the
CLI is absent" — but on dev machines the CLIs can resolve: a user-installed
`gemini` (~/.bun/bin), and the `codex` shim that `bun run` puts on PATH via the
repo's `node_modules/.bin` (from `@openai/codex-sdk`). Then the probe/spawn
succeeds, a real (unauthenticated) turn spins on 401 retries, and the test —
and `bun run verify` — fails. (Standalone `node test/provider-seam.mjs` passed
because plain `node` doesn't prepend `node_modules/.bin`, which made it look flaky.)

- `backends/codex.ts` / `backends/gemini.ts`: CLI binary is overridable via
  `DSGN_CODEX_BIN` / `DSGN_GEMINI_BIN` (default unchanged: `codex` / `gemini`).
- `test/provider-seam.mjs`: launches Electron with both vars pointed at
  nonexistent paths, so the fail-soft assertions hold regardless of what's
  installed; codex `done` assertion now dumps the event stream on failure.

## 2026-07-02 — Viewport (Desktop/Mobile) is now per-project

User report: pick Mobile on one project, open/switch to another → it's Mobile
too. `useViewport` was a single global store, so the toggle leaked across
projects.

- `ProjectEntry.viewport` added to the workspace snapshot (like url/branch):
  `setViewport` writes through to the ACTIVE entry; `applyProject` (rail
  switch) restores the target's own viewport right after `activate` (ordering
  matters — the write-back must land on the incoming entry, not the outgoing);
  `attempt()` sets it after `openOrActivate`, so a fresh open starts at
  desktop and a re-open keeps that project's choice.
- New test `viewport-per-project.mjs` (in `verify`): A→mobile, open B (must be
  desktop), switch A (mobile restored), switch B (desktop kept).

## 2026-07-02 — Fix: doubled/misaligned iPhone bezel in mobile preview

User report: open a project in mobile viewport, open a NEXT project → two
iPhone frames, misaligned. The switch was a red herring — the trigger is the
second project's own CSS. The bezel is an `<img>` injected INTO the previewed
page (so its opaque edge can mask the app's screen corners), which means the
page's stylesheets apply to it: a standard reset like Tailwind preflight's
`img { max-width: 100% }` clamped the upscaled frame (383px) back to the
viewport width (348px), pulling the whole bezel into view as a second squeezed
phone over the app, offset from the renderer's DOM bezel behind it. Projects
without such a reset (like the first one opened) never showed it.

- Fix in `src/preview/preload.ts`: pin the injected frame's geometry against
  page CSS — `max/min-width/height`, `margin/padding/border/transform` locked
  inline with `!important` (an inline `width` alone loses to a stylesheet
  `max-width`), and `positionFrame()` now sets its metrics via
  `setProperty(..., 'important')`. Same hardening for the desktop bottom-corner
  masks (same injected-overlay-vs-page-CSS class of bug).
- New regression test `test/mobile-frame.mjs` (in `verify`): serves a fixture
  WITH the img reset, switches to mobile, and asserts the injected frame
  overflows the viewport on all sides (verified it fails on the pre-fix build).
- Diagnosis harness insight: renderer screenshots can't show this (the native
  view isn't in the DOM) — measure the injected img's rect inside the preview's
  webContents via `executeJavaScript` instead.

User report: an RN/Expo project previews fine, but taps/scrolls do nothing and
Select never picks anything. Two independent bugs, both invisible because every
error on the interaction path was swallowed:

- **`--udid` arg order (the primary bug):** `idbController` invoked
  `idb --udid <udid> ui tap x y` — idb's argparse rejects `--udid` before the
  root command, so **every tap/swipe/text had always failed** with a usage error
  (which only sim-e2e-style live runs could catch; the recording test bridge
  never exercises real idb). The flag must FOLLOW the subcommand:
  `ui tap --udid <udid> x y` (the hit-test path already did this — that's why
  `describe-point` worked while taps didn't). Extracted a pure exported
  `idbUiArgs()` builder and locked the order in `sim-control.mjs`.
- **Stale idb_companion wedges idb (env + resilience):** an `idb_companion`
  that outlives the simulator boot it attached to fails every command with
  "Mach port not connected" — and idb often still **exits 0**, printing the
  error to stderr, so exit-code checks miss it. Meanwhile `simctl` screenshots
  keep streaming → the preview looks alive but ignores input. New: stale-marker
  detection in `idbExec` (stderr scan, `IDB_STALE_RE`), auto-recovery
  (`recoverIdb`: pkill companions + wipe `/tmp/idb`, idb's hardcoded state dir)
  with one retry, and an `idbHealthy()` gate at `start()` (a stale companion
  reports `state: "Shutdown"` for a booted device) so interaction is only
  enabled when idb can actually drive the device — with a clear view-only log
  line when it can't.
- **Feedback instead of silence:** a failed `/control` command now flashes a
  hint on the bridge page (was: ignored response); a select-tap hit-test error
  logs to the simulator log (was: `.catch(() => {})`); and an **unstamped**
  element pick now still surfaces in the Inspector as `source: null` → the
  "project isn't set up" note + setup offer (was: tap did nothing), so a
  third-party Expo app without the RN Babel stamp gets a signposted path
  instead of a dead click. `SimPick.source` is `string | null` now
  (`shared/api.ts` updated to match).

**Verified end-to-end on a real Expo app** (`expo-animations-gallery`) via a live
boot: "idb detected" log → `/control` tap `{ok:true}` → select-mode tap routed as
pick → renderer received `{source:null, tag:"Button"}`. Suite: typecheck + all
sim/select/smoke tests green. Known-unrelated failure: `provider-seam.mjs` now
fails on this machine because a real `gemini` CLI is installed (the test assumes
it absent) — spun off as a separate task.

## 2026-07-01 — Chat: interface for agent questions (AskUserQuestion)

The agent could edit and ask for tool permission, but it had no way to ask the
*user* a clarifying question ("which layout?", "which sections?"). Wired the Claude
Agent SDK's built-in **AskUserQuestion** tool through to an interactive
multiple-choice card in the chat.

- **New event contract** (`shared/api.ts`): `QuestionSpec`/`QuestionOption`/
  `QuestionRequest` + `QuestionAnswers`; `AgentEvent` gains `question-request` and
  `question-resolved` (mirroring the permission pair); `DsgnApi.agent.respondQuestion`.
- **Backend interception** (`backends/claude.ts`): `canUseTool` catches
  `AskUserQuestion` **before** the permission machinery (so it never shows an
  approve/deny card), parses the loosely-typed input into `QuestionSpec[]`, emits
  `question-request`, and awaits the user's picks in a per-session `pendingQuestions`
  map (added to the `ProviderSession` seam, optional so non-Claude backends can skip
  it). The answer is fed back as the tool result by **denying with the answer as the
  message** — in headless SDK mode there's no built-in interactive prompt to run, so
  intercepting here keeps the whole exchange under dsgn's control; the message is
  phrased as an answer so the model continues with the choice in hand. Aborts/teardown
  release open questions (dismiss) so the SDK callback always unblocks.
- **IPC** (`agent.ts`): `agent:respond-question` settles the awaiting callback;
  `interrupt` + `closeSession` release any unanswered questions.
- **Renderer**: `useQuestions` store (pending queue, deduped by id, cleared on project
  switch — like `usePermissions`); `QuestionCards.tsx` renders each question with a
  header chip, the question, option buttons (label + description), an always-available
  free-text **Other…**, and **Skip**/**Send**. Single single-select questions submit on
  click; multi-select / multi-question requests collect picks then Send. App routes the
  question events (alongside the permission events); ChatPanel renders the cards above
  the composer.
- **Test**: `test/questions.mjs` (store-driven, no creds) — single-select auto-submit,
  multi-select + Send, Skip, and a `question-resolved` event clearing an open card. Added
  to `verify`. Full credential-independent suite green (`10-question-card.png`). The live
  canUseTool round-trip rides `agent-e2e` (gated on `claude login`).

## 2026-06-27 — v7: Codex backend made real (solo prep; live verify gated on `codex login`)

Took `backends/codex.ts` from a speculative stub (shape-guessing against docs, non-literal
import so it built without the package) to a real adapter against the installed SDK.

- **`@openai/codex-sdk@0.142.3`** added as a real dependency. ESM-only, so loaded via a
  dynamic `import()` and externalized by electron-vite (verified `import("@openai/codex-sdk")`
  survives in the CJS main bundle) — same pattern as the Claude SDK.
- **Rewrote against the REAL typed API** (read `dist/index.d.ts`): `new Codex().startThread(
  ThreadOptions)` → `Thread.runStreamed(input, { signal }) → { events: AsyncGenerator<ThreadEvent> }`.
  Mapping: `item.{started,updated,completed}` with `agent_message` → streaming deltas (per-item
  suffix diff); `file_change` → status + `cap.noteTool('Edit', {file_path})` (→ filesTouched);
  `command_execution`/`web_search`/`mcp_tool_call`/`reasoning` → status lines; `turn.failed`/
  `error` → error. `interrupt` wired via a per-turn AbortController; `shutdown` aborts + flags.
  `model`/`effort` honored via ThreadOptions; headless `approvalPolicy:'never'` + `sandboxMode:
  'workspace-write'`.
- **Fast preflight**: `codex --version` up front → a missing/unauthed CLI fails soft instantly
  with an "install + `codex login`" message, instead of a slow mid-turn spawn ENOENT.
- **Fixed a real multi-provider UX bug**: a non-Claude auth error used to render "⚠️ Not connected
  to Claude" and raise the Claude-specific onboarding banner (setup-token). Now the Claude note +
  banner are gated to `provider === 'claude'`; Codex/Gemini show their own descriptive error.
- **Tests**: `test/codex-e2e.mjs` (mirrors agent-e2e on the codex backend; SKIPs cleanly until
  the user runs `codex login`, then proves the live event mapping). `provider-seam.mjs` hardened
  to poll for `done` (the preflight subprocess made the old fixed-sleep flaky under load). Full
  verify green: 43 OK, codex-e2e + sim-e2e SKIP (gated).
- **Remaining (needs the user):** `codex login`, then codex-e2e verifies live; Codex tool-approval
  → permission-card mapping (deferred — no approval-request event in the SDK stream).

## 2026-06-27 — v6 stretch: collapsible tool-step disclosure (AI Elements Task pattern)

A long agent turn used to render its tool-use statuses as a flat list that pushed the
actual answer down the panel. Now each assistant message's steps collapse into a
`StepDisclosure` — the AI-Elements Task/Reasoning pattern, built on the **already-vendored
shadcn `Collapsible`** (no new Radix dep): collapsed shows the latest step + a count
(`› Edit · src/components/Hero.tsx · 2 steps`), expandable to the full list. It auto-opens
while the turn is live (watch progress), auto-collapses when it finishes, and respects a
manual toggle in between. Tests only read `statuses` from the store (not the status DOM),
so the restructure was safe; `chat-render.mjs` gains a collapse→expand assertion. Picked
this over the shadcn-Select picker conversion (which would need a new Radix dep + flaky
portal-based test interaction for modest polish). Full verify green.

## 2026-06-27 — v8 F1 Phase 3: per-repo cap + FIFO queue + interrupt (F1 complete)

The "N parallel agents never wedge or leak" hardening — completes F1 and v8.

- **Cap + queue** (`agent.ts`): `MAX_SPAWNS_PER_REPO = 3`. A spawn over the cap is pushed
  to a FIFO `spawnQueue` (returns `{queued:true}`); `pumpQueue(parentKey)` runs on each
  `finalizeSpawn` and starts the next queued spawn as a slot frees. The spawn id is
  assigned UP FRONT so the rail row is stable across the queued→running flip; a
  `spawn-started` event carries the branch when a queued spawn actually starts.
  `startSpawn` is the shared create-worktree-+-start path (immediate and dequeued),
  reclaiming the worktree + pumping the queue on any failure.
- **Interrupt** (`agent:spawn-interrupt`): cancels a running spawn (`session.interrupt()` →
  done → finalize commits whatever it did) or drops a still-queued one. Surfaced as a ×
  on each rail working/queued row.
- **Already landed in the F1 review fixes:** startup orphan-prune (open-project) and
  before-quit-leave-for-prune (no work lost), so Phase 3's leak/recovery items were done.
- Renderer: `useSpawns` gains `queued` status + a `start()` transition; ChatPanel handles
  `spawn-started`; App sets the initial status from `queued`; Rail shows a grey queued dot
  + the interrupt ×. `spawn-comment.mjs` covers the queued→running→removed lifecycle.
- **v8 is now complete:** R1, F3a, F3b, F2, F1 (all 4 phases) shipped. Deferred niceties:
  per-spawn Bash allowlist, a rich ConflictPanel, non-Claude spawn backends.

## 2026-06-27 — v8 F1 Phase 2: Apply / PR / Discard a finished comment spawn

Closes the loop — a spawn's work, previously stranded on its `dsgn/comment-<id>` branch,
now reaches the preview.

- `worktrees.ts`: `branchPatch(repoRoot, branch)` = `<branch>^..<branch>` (the spawn's
  single commit — exactly its edits, not the WIP base), plus `deleteBranch` / `branchExists`.
- `agent.ts`: `agent:spawn-apply` (patch the branch diff onto the LIVE tree via the same
  `applyToWorkingTree` — plain apply, `--3way` fallback, conflict reported), `agent:
  spawn-discard` (delete the branch), `agent:spawn-pr` (push + `gh pr create --head <branch>`
  with origin/gh preflight; persists prUrl onto the history record).
- `SessionReview` gains an action bar for `kind:'comment'` records: **Apply** (preview HMRs
  the change), **Open PR**, **Discard** (deletes branch + drops the record). Conflicts/errors
  surface as a colored note. (Rich ConflictPanel deferred — a status note for now.)
- `spawn-comment.mjs` adds a deterministic Apply/Discard round-trip (hand-built branch, no
  model): apply lands the edit on the live tree, discard deletes the branch. Full verify green.

## 2026-06-27 — v8 F1 (phases 0+1): comment → parallel agent in its own git worktree

**Contention decided by a design judge-panel** (3 models architected against the real
seam, scored on correctness/effort/UX): **worktree-per-spawn** won (7.33) over advisory
conflict-detection (7.0) and a serialized write-lock (5.33). Each comment-spawned agent
runs in its OWN `git worktree` on a `dsgn/comment-<id>` branch — a private checkout
sharing the object store — so N comments edit the repo in true parallel with zero
cross-writes. The judges' correctness flag (merging a spawn branch back fails against the
main agent's uncommitted WIP) is fixed by patch-applying the spawn's diff onto the live
tree (`git apply`/`--3way`), not `git merge`.

- **Phase 0 — `src/main/worktrees.ts`** (pure git, the de-risking crux): createWorktree
  forks off the live tree's CURRENT state including WIP (via `git stash create`, no side
  effects); commitWorktree returns git's authoritative file list; diffWorktree
  (`--full-index --binary`); applyToWorkingTree (plain apply, `--3way` fallback, conflict
  detection — NOT `git merge`); removeWorktree + pruneOrphans (crash recovery), never
  throw. `test/worktrees.mjs` proves isolation, WIP-preserving fork, apply-onto-dirty-tree.
- **Phase 1 — the spawn slice.** `SpawnContext` added to the backend seam (claude.ts
  threads `emitKey`/`sessionId`/`onEvent`); a spawn files its events + history under the
  PARENT project key but stamps `sessionId`. `agent.ts` gets a separate `spawns` map
  (never touches `activeKey`), `agent:spawn-comment` (bypassPermissions — headless, no
  card UI; creates a worktree, starts a detached session), and `finalizeSpawn` (closeSession
  → persist under parent → commitWorktree → save git file-list → removeWorktree keeping the
  branch → emit `spawn-finished`). Renderer: `useSpawns` store, `App.onComment` dispatches
  a spawn (falls back to seeding chat for non-repos), `ChatPanel.onEvent` drops any
  `sessionId` event before the chat router (the byte-clean-main-stream guarantee) and on
  `spawn-finished` reloads history, `Rail` shows a pulsing working row that becomes a
  previous-agent on finish.
- **Tests:** `test/spawn-comment.mjs` — deterministic (non-repo fallback; a `sessionId`
  delta proven NOT to enter the active chat; row add→spawn-finished→remove) PLUS a LIVE
  spawn that had a real Claude agent edit a temp git repo in its own worktree and commit to
  a `dsgn/comment-<id>` branch with main untouched. Full `verify` green (live spawn +
  AGENT-E2E both ran).
- **Adversarial review (4-dimension workflow, each finding verified) → 10 confirmed,
  all fixed before merge:**
  - `git stash create` silently drops UNTRACKED files — a spawn would fork from a base
    missing brand-new files the interactive agent just created. Replaced with a
    throwaway-index `captureBase` (read-tree HEAD → add -A → write-tree → commit-tree)
    that snapshots tracked + untracked WIP.
  - `App.tsx`'s second `onEvent` listener lacked the `sessionId` guard → a spawn's init
    `commands` overwrote the active slash menu and its auth error raised the onboarding
    banner. Guarded (main broadcasts to both listeners).
  - A spawn whose `startSession` threw (SDK load / not logged in) leaked its worktree
    (created before the `spawns.set`) → now reclaimed in a catch.
  - `pruneOrphans` was written + tested but never CALLED → wired at open-project (skips
    ids of spawns live this session so it can't reap an active checkout).
  - `before-quit` did `removeWorktree` fire-and-forget → discarded uncommitted work and
    raced exit. Now just stops the subprocess; next launch's pruneOrphans commits the
    dirty leftover to its branch and reclaims it.
  - bypassPermissions skips the `canUseTool` sidecar deny, and `.dsgn/` isn't gitignored
    → a spawn could land sidecar writes on the live tree via Apply. `commitWorktree` now
    unstages `.dsgn` so it never reaches the branch/patch. (Bash allowlist still deferred.)
  - `git worktree add` races on shared admin state → `createWorktree` serialized behind
    an in-process chain.
- **Deferred to F1 phases 2–3:** Apply/PR/Discard on a finished row (+ ConflictPanel),
  per-repo cap + queue, before-quit finalize hardening, per-spawn Bash allowlist,
  non-Claude backends. The spawn's edits currently live on the branch (reviewable via the
  existing transcript path); reaching the live preview is Phase 2.

## 2026-06-27 — v8 F2: broaden direct editing (schema defaults + reset-to-default)

- **Scoped first** (Explore agent): the literal-recognition set in `props.ts` is already
  broad — expression-container literals (`count={3}`, `active={true}`), TS casts, no-sub
  template literals, unary minus all read as clean literals; genuine expressions (handlers,
  member/array/object) correctly route to chat. So F2 wasn't "recognize more literals" —
  the gaps were **no schema defaults** and **no removal/reset**.
- **Schema defaults**: `docgenPropToField` now parses react-docgen's `defaultValue` source
  string into a typed `PropField.default` (handles `'brand'` / `3` / `false`, drops
  computed/ill-typed). The panel shows `default: X` per field. (react-docgen does extract
  destructuring defaults like `{ tone = 'brand' }` for function components — confirmed live.)
- **Reset-to-default**: new `props.remove(root, source, name)` IPC → `removeProp` (React) /
  `removeSvelteProp` (Svelte) deletes the attribute from source, collapsing one run of
  adjacent whitespace so nothing dangles. Routes through `commitEdit`, so a reset is
  reversible with Cmd+Z (F3b). An already-absent prop is a no-op success.
- **UI**: PropPanel shows a `reset` link only for props actually present on the element and
  **not required** (removing a required prop would break the component) — verified in the
  10-prop-editor.png artifact (variant*/label* have no reset; count/rounded do).
- Tests: `prop-edit.mjs` gains a `Chip` destructuring-default fixture (default extraction +
  reset→remove→undo + absent-prop no-op); `prop-edit-svelte.mjs` gains a `.svelte`
  reset→remove→undo. Full `verify` green (live AGENT-E2E passed).

## 2026-06-27 — v8 F3b: undo/redo for ALL direct dsgn source edits

- New `src/main/edit-history.ts` — the reversible-edit engine. Every direct apply path
  now routes through a shared `commitEdit(root, file, before, after, key)` (in props.ts,
  imported by props-svelte.ts): it writes, then `recordEdit`s the before/after. Covers
  React + Svelte props, inline text, and token swaps (T1/T2/T3) — not just the new panel.
- **Coalescing**: rapid edits of the same target (`source:prop` / `:text` / `:token`)
  within 500ms collapse to one undo step (a slider drag isn't 30 Cmd+Zs), keeping the
  original `before` so one undo reverts the whole burst.
- **Conflict guard**: undo/redo read the file's CURRENT content and refuse to write if it
  diverged from what we last wrote (the user edited it in their own editor) — surfaced in
  the renderer as a status error, never a silent clobber.
- **Per-project-root stacks**: the v5-C rail keeps several projects open, so history is
  keyed by root — Cmd+Z in project B never reverts a file in project A. Cleared on
  `agent:close-project`.
- IPC `edit:undo/redo/can` (root-scoped) → preload `window.api.edits` → renderer global
  keydown (Cmd+Z / Cmd+Shift+Z / Cmd+Y), skipped while typing in a field; re-inspects the
  selected element after a revert so the panel reflects the new source.
- Tests: `test/edit-history.mjs` (unit — record/coalesce/undo/redo/conflict/root-scope) +
  an apply→undo→redo→conflict round-trip appended to `test/prop-edit.mjs`. Full `verify`
  green (live AGENT-E2E passed; SIM-E2E skipped, no Xcode).

## 2026-06-27 — three stacked features: v5-D history UI, inspector→shadcn, direct prop/token edit

Built as stacked PRs off main (#28 → #31 → #32); each its own full `verify` + a
multi-agent adversarial review with fixes applied. Designed via a parallel design
workflow; reviewed via per-PR review workflows.

- **PR #28 — v5-D previous-agents history**, re-homed onto the v7 seam. Capture moved
  into a shared `backends/record.ts` (reused by claude + codex; `ProviderSession` gained
  `record`+`finalize`); persist on teardown in `agent.ts`. Renderer: `useHistory`, the
  rail previous-sessions sub-list, and the `SessionReview` modal. Review caught two real
  HIGH bugs (rail sub-list clipped horizontally → stack vertically; the modal was occluded
  by the native preview → hide it while open).
- **PR #31 — inspector surfaces → shadcn**: Inspector/Notes/Tokens/PropPanel migrated,
  every test hook preserved, dead CSS removed. The whole chat panel is now Tailwind+shadcn.
- **PR #32 — direct (agent-free) prop+token editing**: broadened literals (TS casts +
  no-sub template literals) and a new `applyToken` IPC (T1 schema-enum swap + T3 inline-
  style swap), agent fallback otherwise. Review caught a real correctness bug — T3 matched
  on value-family only, so a color token could land in `fontWeight`; fixed by gating on the
  CSS property name (+ a re-inspect race guard).

**Learnings:**
- **Stacked PRs** are the clean way to ship interdependent work when you can't auto-merge:
  #2 and #3 both touch `Inspector.tsx`; branching #3 off #2 (off #1) means each PR's diff
  is just its own change and there are zero conflicts — merge bottom-up, GitHub retargets.
- **Re-homing across a refactor** (v5-D capture built against the pre-v7 monolith) is a
  *manual* re-apply, never a cherry-pick — the old `agent.ts` would clobber the seam. A
  shared helper (`record.ts`) kept each provider's change to ~4 lines.
- **Tailwind v4's CSS parser chokes on an apostrophe even inside a `/* */` comment**
  ("Unterminated string") — keep comments apostrophe-free.
- **Renderer-DOM modals are occluded by the native `WebContentsView` preview** — hide the
  preview (reuse the drag `setVisible` path) while any centered overlay is open. The
  PropPanel inset-strip pattern only works for edge-docked panels.
- **Direct edits from semi-trusted token files** are injection-safe via `JSON.stringify`
  into the JS string literal, but **family checks must gate on the CSS property name**, not
  just the value shape, or you write a valid-but-wrong value silently.

## 2026-06-26 — v7: ModelProvider seam + Codex backend scaffold

Started multi-provider backends. **User decision: subscription login, not BYO API
key** — so we wrap each vendor's subscription-auth coding-agent SDK/CLI (Codex SDK,
Gemini CLI, Grok Build CLI), not the Vercel AI SDK. Each brings its own tools, so
the spike's ~6–8 day tool-suite rebuild evaporates. See `docs/v7-multi-provider-design.md`.

**Shipped (commit 8f2bd71):** the seam under `src/main/backends/` —
- `types.ts` — `ModelProvider`/`ProviderSession`/`PendingPrompt`. `agent.ts` is now
  backend-agnostic (session map / activeKey / teardown / permission settle-loop /
  `agent:*` IPC, all in terms of `ProviderSession` + `AgentEvent`).
- `claude.ts` — the incumbent Claude Agent SDK session extracted **verbatim** behind
  the seam (`InputStream`, `canUseTool`, streaming loop). `tools.ts` holds the shared
  tool policy (moved out of `agent.ts` to avoid an import cycle).
- `codex.ts` — EXPERIMENTAL OpenAI Codex via `@openai/codex-sdk` (sign-in-with-ChatGPT).
- `index.ts` — `pickProvider(options.provider)`, default Claude.
- `AgentOptions.provider`; `test/provider-seam.mjs`.

**The big safety property:** the Claude path is **byte-identical** — full `verify`
incl. the real AGENT-E2E turn passes through the new indirection. Non-Claude is
reachable only when the renderer sets `provider`, so default runtime is unchanged.

**Learnings:**
- Extracting the load-bearing `agent.ts` was a clean "pure move" precisely because
  the IPC layer already optional-chained the live controls (`query.setModel?.` etc.)
  — those became `ProviderSession.setModel?` with zero handler changes.
- **Lazy non-literal dynamic import** (`const PKG: string = '@openai/codex-sdk';
  await import(PKG)`) lets an optional backend compile + ship WITHOUT its package
  installed (TS types it `any`, no module resolution) — it fails soft at runtime
  (error + done) so a missing SDK / not-logged-in routes to the login banner instead
  of crashing. Same trick the Claude SDK uses for ESM-in-CJS, applied to optionality.
- Codex/Gemini/Grok each **bring their own hardened toolset** — we don't define one;
  the provider just maps their event stream to dsgn's `delta`/`status`/`done`/`error`.
- Still gated on a real `codex login` to verify the live event mapping (can't be
  tested without the user's subscription session).

## 2026-06-26 — v6: chat panel → Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui + AI Elements

Migrated the chat panel off plain CSS onto Tailwind + shadcn (branch
`dsgn/v6-chat-shadcn`). Decision rule applied per feature: shadcn primitive →
AI Elements → custom. Full `verify` green (all ~30 tests incl. AGENT-E2E).

**Shipped (3 commits):**
- **Scaffold** — Tailwind v4 via `@tailwindcss/vite`, `@` alias, hand-written
  `components.json`, shadcn neutral/new-york tokens in `styles.css` (renamed
  `--accent/--border/--radius` → `--*-shadcn`/`--shadcn-radius` to avoid colliding
  with our legacy vars), `@layer base` border default, `lib/utils.ts` (cn). shadcn
  primitives under `components/ui/*`; AI Elements `conversation` under
  `components/ai-elements/`. Additive — existing plain-CSS UI visually unchanged.
- **Chat core** — message list → AI Elements `<Conversation>` (stick-to-bottom,
  replaces the manual scroll effect); user messages → shadcn muted bubble;
  assistant kept on our `react-markdown`. Composer → shadcn `<InputGroup>` +
  `<InputGroupAddon block-end>` + native textarea (`data-slot=input-group-control`
  for the focus ring); send/stop → shadcn `<Button>` (lucide ArrowUp). Pickers stay
  native `<select>`; slash menu stays custom (textarea-driven).
- **Cards** — PermissionCards / SetupCard / TokenOfferCard → shadcn `<Button>` +
  Tailwind alert surfaces; legacy `.perm*/.setup*` CSS removed (classes kept as
  test hooks). Dense element-inspector surfaces backlogged.

**Learnings (the non-obvious bits):**
- **shadcn CLI alias resolution reads the ROOT `tsconfig.json`, not per-project
  tsconfigs.** With our project-references root (no `paths`), `shadcn add` couldn't
  resolve `@` and wrote to a literal `@/` dir + `src/components/`. Fix: add
  `baseUrl`+`paths @/*` to the root tsconfig; for the already-scattered run we
  relocated files under `src/renderer/src/` + hand-wrote `lib/utils.ts` (the CLI
  skipped it) + appended the CSS tokens manually.
- **The new "shadcn chat primitives" (message/bubble/marker/message-scroller) are
  NOT in the public registry** under those names (`new-york-v4/message.json` 404).
  The research over-trusted a docs-page scrape. Reality: use `input-group` (real) +
  AI Elements `conversation` (real, lightweight — only `use-stick-to-bottom`, no
  `ai`/streamdown). AI Elements `message` pulls `ai`+`streamdown`, so the message
  row is custom + our Markdown. **Always validate registry names by running the CLI.**
- **Tailwind v4 preflight is safe next to legacy CSS** because v4 emits into
  `@layer` and our legacy rules are unlayered (always win). The flip side: a
  migrated element's Tailwind utilities LOSE to any leftover unlayered legacy rule,
  so each migrated block needs its conflicting *properties* stripped (we kept the
  class as a bare hook). Did this for `.chat__messages`, `.composer__input`,
  `.perm*`, `.setup*`.
- **React 18 + shadcn new-york:** components are React-19-style (no `forwardRef`).
  Don't pass a ref into a shadcn leaf (Textarea/Input/Button) — it won't attach.
  The composer keeps a NATIVE textarea for its `inputRef` (seeding/cursor). Radix
  (`radix-ui@1.6`) works on React 18.
- **Test contract held with ZERO test edits** by preserving every selector
  (`.composer__input` is the readiness gate for ~20 tests) + keeping pickers native
  (the permission-mode test reads `<option>`s via `$$eval`).

## 2026-06-26 — v5-C2: LRU-cap warm agent sessions

- Closes the resource gap left after v5-C: the dev-server LRU cap (N=3) was in,
  but each open project still held a live agent SDK CLI subprocess unbounded. Now
  the same eviction bounds **both**.
- **`agent.ts`** — new `agent:is-open` IPC (`sessions.has(projectKey(root))`) so the
  renderer can tell a suspended session from a live one.
- **`App.tsx` `evictWarm`** (was `evictWarmServers`) — beyond the N most-recent
  projects, suspend the LRU ones by stopping the dev server **and** closing the
  agent session. Never reaps the active project, a simulator, or a project whose
  agent is mid-turn (`useChat.isRunningFor` — sticky from submit until `done`, so it
  protects backgrounded in-flight turns too). Re-reads live `activeKey`/running
  right before the destructive stops to dodge a switch-back TOCTOU.
- **`App.tsx` `applyProject`** — on switch-back, if `agent.isOpen` is false the
  session was LRU-suspended, so it's reopened via `agent.openProject` (awaited +
  try/catch, with a clear "prior context cleared" log note — the reopened session
  starts fresh; the visible transcript is kept for reference). Otherwise just
  `setActive`. Mirrors the dead/suspended dev-server relaunch path.
- Tradeoff (documented): suspending closes the SDK subprocess, so an evicted
  project's *agent context* is lost (its chat transcript is preserved for display).
  Real resume lands with v5-D (session persistence).
- Test: `test/agent-cap.mjs` — is-open liveness, LRU suspend leaves peers open,
  reopen re-activates. Full `bun run verify` green (31 OK, agent-e2e/sim-e2e SKIP
  without creds/Xcode).

## 2026-06-26 — proactive checks C1/C3: error extraction + rule-based diagnosis

- Real-world driver: an Expo build failed and dsgn surfaced the xcodebuild
  *dependency-graph* dump, not the actual cause — a stale Homebrew node keg pinned
  in `ios/.xcode.env.local` (`dyld: Library not loaded … Abort trap: 6`). Fixed the
  project (repoint NODE_BINARY) and hardened dsgn so it catches this class itself.
- **`extractBuildError(log)`** in `src/main/xcode.ts` (pure): pulls high-signal
  lines (dyld / Abort trap / PhaseScriptExecution / `error:` / linker) out of a
  build log and drops the "Explicit dependency on target …" graph noise. Wired into
  both `spawnMetro` reject paths (build-fail + early-exit); tail buffer 4k→8k.
- **`src/main/diag-rules.ts`** — layer 2 of the proactive-checks plan: pure
  `matchKnownError(text)` maps known signatures → known fixes (instant, offline)
  *before* the AI. First rule: broken NODE_BINARY → repo-scoped fix (rewrite
  `.xcode.env.local`) + optional host `brew cleanup node`. Wired into `diagnose:run`
  between the recall-cache and `aiDiagnose`; renders through the same DiagnoseCard.
- Tests: `extractBuildError` cases in `test/xcode.mjs`; new bun `test/diag-rules.mjs`
  (matches the node failure, no false positives on unrelated dyld/unknown errors).
  Added to the test/verify chains. Full verify green; `SIM-PREFLIGHT ok=true` now
  that the 26.5 runtime is installed.

## 2026-06-26 — v5-C rail: multiple open projects + switching (the payoff)

- **dsgn is now multi-project.** A left sidebar (`Rail.tsx`, Cursor-style) lists
  the open repos with an active highlight, a per-project "working" dot (green when
  that project's agent turn is in flight — incl. backgrounded ones), an × to close,
  and "+ New project" which opens another **keeping the current one warm** (its dev
  server + agent session keep running for an instant switch). The rail only shows
  once a project is open (single-project keeps the old layout).
- `ProjectEntry` now carries a per-project display snapshot (url / previewKind /
  branch / launchSpec); `patchEntry` updates it. `attempt(root, cmd?, keepWarm)`
  skips the single-active teardown when keeping warm and snapshots the project it
  leaves. `switchTo`/`applyProject` swap the preview (navigate the one
  WebContentsView to the target URL), the active agent session (`agent:setActive`),
  the per-project chat (`useChat.setActiveChat`), tokens, annotations, branch,
  status — no restart. `closeProjectFromRail` stops the server + session and falls
  through to another open project (or idle).
- New `test/rail.mjs`: open two fixtures (second keeps the first warm), assert both
  servers stay reachable, switching swaps the preview port + the per-project chat
  slice. Screenshot `10-rail.png`. Full verify green.
- Adversarial review (10 findings) hardened it: switching a warm project whose dev
  server **died/was suspended** now probes (`devServer.isRunning`) and relaunches it
  before navigating (no dead frame); `applyProject` clears the outgoing tokens/pins
  up front and guards the annotations write against a rapid re-switch (+ a
  `stillActive` re-check after every await); **LRU-suspend** caps warm dev servers at
  3 (the decided behavior — beyond that the least-recently-used are stopped and
  relaunch on return); project entries are kept current (open/restart/branch-rename
  patch them) so switching needs no stale-closure snapshot; `closeProjectFromRail`
  awaits the session close before clearing chat and avoids a double-stop on the last
  project; test isolation assertion strengthened (content, not counts).

## 2026-06-26 — v5-C core: per-project chat + event routing (keep-running)

- The machinery behind the chosen "backgrounded agents keep running, badge on
  return" behavior. `agent.ts` `emit` now tags every event with its session's
  `projectKey` and emits for ALL live sessions (dropped the active-only guard);
  new `agent:set-active(root)` switches a warm session without recreating it.
- `useChat` is now per-project: `byKey[projectKey]` slices (messages + isRunning +
  the streaming message id moved into the slice), with the active slice mirrored
  into the top-level `messages`/`isRunning` so ChatPanel + the Playwright store
  harness read it **unchanged**. Chat actions take an optional key (default =
  active); ChatPanel's `agent:event` handler routes by `event.projectKey` — the
  active project streams live, a backgrounded project accumulates into its own
  slice (the rail's "working" dot) and its output is there on switch-back.
- App sets the active chat to the open project, clears a project's slice on
  close/switch-away. New `test/chat-route.mjs` injects `agent:event`s from main
  (no creds) and proves routing + background accumulation + switch-reveal. Full
  verify green; `chat-render`/`comment-mode`/`agent-multi` unchanged. Rail UI next.
- Review fixes: `patch` uses `?? activeKey` (an explicit `''` is its own slice, not
  collapsed into the active project); open clears the project's chat slice first
  (so a trailing event from a disposed session can't surface stale content on
  reopen) and `stop` awaits `closeProject` before clearing.

## 2026-06-25 — v5-B: one agent session per project (S8)

- `src/main/agent.ts`: replaced the single `session` + monotonic `currentEpoch`
  with a `Map<projectKey, Session>` plus an `activeKey`. Each open project keeps
  its own persistent `query()` session (cwd = its repo); only the **active**
  project's session streams to the renderer (`emit` guards on
  `!disposed && key === activeKey`), so a backgrounded session kept warm for a
  fast switch can't leak into the visible chat. `permCounter` moved per-session and
  its fallback ids are namespaced by project key (no cross-session collisions).
- `agent:open-project` creates/replaces+activates a session for its key;
  `send`/`setModel`/`setPermissionMode`/`respond-permission`/`interrupt` route to
  the active session; `before-quit` closes all. New `agent:close-project` (+
  `DsgnApi.agent.closeProject`) tears a project's session down; the renderer calls
  it in the single-active teardown (switching), the failed-open cleanup, and stop.
- New `test/agent-multi.mjs` proves the lifecycle without Claude creds — it probes
  the synchronous "no active session" error to verify per-project sessions, active
  routing, and close semantics (open A,B → active; close the active → cleared, NOT
  auto-promoted; reopen re-activates; close last → none). Full verify green;
  single-project agent path unchanged.
- Review fix: closing the active project clears `activeKey` (it never auto-promotes
  a backgrounded session — which would start emitting into a chat the renderer
  isn't showing once the rail keeps sessions warm); the renderer re-activates
  explicitly via open-project.

## 2026-06-25 — v5-A: multi-instance dev servers (S7)

- `src/main/devserver.ts`: replaced the single `current` ChildProcess with a
  `Map<projectKey, ChildProcess>` — several projects' dev servers run at once.
  `start(opts.root)` pre-empts only that project's prior server (restart) and
  leaves others; `stop(root)` kills one process group + deletes its entry;
  `stopAll()` on `before-quit`; the spawn registers an `exit` handler that prunes
  the map if a server dies on its own. The timeout targets only the timed-out root.
- Contract: `devserver:stop` + `DsgnApi.devServer.stop` gain a `root`; preload +
  the three App callers thread it. Single-active behavior is preserved at the
  renderer (opening another project stops the previous one and drops it from the
  workspace; the rail will skip that to keep projects warm). Running servers hold
  their ports, so `findFreePort` hands out distinct ones naturally.
- New `test/devserver-multi.mjs`: two fixtures' servers run concurrently on
  distinct ports, both reachable, and `stop(rootA)` leaves B running. Full verify
  green (open-preview / setup-restart single-project paths unchanged).
- Adversarial review caught a real **free-port race** (concurrent starts both
  probed 7777 → same port): added a serialized `allocatePort` + reserved-port set
  so concurrent starts get distinct ports (released on exit). Also: the 90s
  timeout now kills the *captured* child (identity-guarded), not whatever's in the
  map for that key (a restart could otherwise kill the newer server); a failed
  `attempt` stops the dev server it started (no orphan); the test was strengthened
  (both fixtures honor `PORT` so the allocator is actually under test) and polls
  until-down instead of a fixed sleep.

## 2026-06-25 — iOS simulator build-destination preflight (the 26.5 gap)

- Root cause of "iOS 26.5 is not installed" after a multi-minute build: modern
  Xcode couples a simulator *build* to a runtime ≥ its active SDK version. The old
  preflight only counted `simctl` devices, which still listed 26.0/26.1 devices,
  so it went green while the build was already doomed.
- **`simBuildDestination(sdkVersion, runtimeVersions)`** in `src/main/xcode.ts`
  (pure, with `parseVersion`/`cmpVersion`): fails when no installed runtime ≥ the
  SDK, handing back the one-line fix (`xcodebuild -downloadPlatform iOS`). Unknown/
  unparseable SDK never blocks (degrade safe). Unit-tested in `test/xcode.mjs`.
- `preflight()` now probes `xcrun --sdk iphonesimulator --show-sdk-version` and the
  runtime versions, and returns this reason *before* booting + building.
- Kicked off the 8.52 GB `xcodebuild -downloadPlatform iOS` for this machine's
  missing 26.5 runtime (consented).
- **`docs/PLAN-proactive-checks.md`** — the layered "preflight rules" design this
  generalizes into: proactive checks → rule-based failure matching → AI diagnose
  fallback, all feeding the existing propose-first card + per-machine memory.

## 2026-06-25 — v5 foundation: projectKey + workspace store (S0/S2)

- First, non-collision slices of the v5 multi-project roadmap (a planning workflow
  mapped the single-instance machinery and ordered the slices to avoid the parallel
  session's main-process edits — see `docs/TASKS.md` v5).
- **S0** — `src/shared/projectKey.ts`: a pure, string-only canonical key for an open
  project (separator/trailing-slash normalized, idempotent). Every later
  `Map<root,*>` (dev servers, agent sessions, preview state, the renderer
  workspace) keys on this so main and renderer dedupe the same repo. Pure bun test
  `test/project-key.mjs`.
- **S2** — `useWorkspace` store (renderer): the future source of truth for
  multi-project — `projects[]` + `activeKey`, with `openOrActivate/activate/close`
  keyed by `projectKey`. Wired live for the single open project (App populates it on
  open, clears on stop) but otherwise additive/dormant until the rail + multi-instance
  backends land. Exercised in `test/chat-render.mjs` (`__dsgnWorkspace`).
- Deferred + why: the multi-instance **main** refactors (dev servers S7, agent
  sessions S8, preview state S9) are HIGH-collision with the parallel session's
  active `main/index.ts`/`agent.ts`/`devserver.ts` work and gated on lifecycle
  decisions (warm vs suspend, caps) — left for coordination. The per-project store
  fan-out (S3–S6) is a large dormant renderer refactor better done with the user in
  the loop. See the session's blocking questions.

## 2026-06-25 — Figma-style inline comment (C) + annotation (Y) modes

- Press **C** → comment mode, **Y** → annotation mode (also toolbar buttons). Click
  an element in the preview and an inline composer (a pill in the overlay's shadow
  root) anchors to it. Submitting a **comment** sends it straight to the agent
  (element ref + your text); an **annotation** pins a note (no agent), reusing the
  existing `.dsgn/annotations.json` engine + pins.
- Layered onto the existing select overlay in `src/preview/preload.ts` (select
  stays byte-identical): a `commentMode` state, the shadow-DOM composer, capture-
  phase C/Y/Esc keys (guarded against the page's own text fields + modifiers), and
  click→`openComposer`→submit. Modes are mutually exclusive with select. New
  channels: `set-comment-mode` (renderer→preload), `comment-mode` (keyboard echo),
  `comment` (submit) — all sender-gated in main and cached across preview reloads.
- Renderer: `useSelection.commentMode` mirrors the preview (toolbar reflects
  keyboard arming); a submitted comment routes via a new one-shot `useComposer.submit`
  (auto-sends, or prefills if a turn is running so it's never dropped); an
  annotation calls `annotations.add`. Comment text is capped/sanitized into the
  prompt. New `test/comment-mode.mjs` drives the full path end to end (arm → click
  → shadow composer → send → agent turn / annotation pin) through real IPC.
- Adversarial review fixes: the composer self-heals if its frozen element is
  removed by HMR (`isConnected` guard in `onMove`, mirroring the text-edit path);
  `preview:reset` clears `commentModeActive` for parity with `selectModeActive` (no
  stale re-arm on project switch); and an annotation submitted before the session
  is ready logs feedback instead of dropping silently.

## 2026-06-25 — AI diagnose-on-failure → propose-first fix card + per-machine memory

- When opening/launching a project fails (web or simulator — both throw into the
  one `attempt` catch), dsgn now asks the agent to **diagnose** it and shows a
  **propose-first** card: a one-line root cause + numbered steps, each tagged
  **repo** (a fix dsgn can apply) or **host** (sudo / global / download — the user
  runs it), with the exact shell command + a Copy button. Nothing runs
  automatically (user-chosen). "Apply repo fix" seeds the chat with the repo steps
  for the agent to execute (reviewed + sent); host steps are copy-only.
- **Per-machine memory** (user-chosen scope): `src/main/diag-cache.ts` (pure, fs)
  caches each diagnosis in the app's userData (NOT the repo), keyed by project path
  + a normalized error **signature** (paths/ids/numbers stripped, so the same error
  class recalls instantly across runs). A repeat error is recalled with "seen before"
  — no model call. `diagnose:record` stores applied/dismissed.
- **One-shot, tool-less SDK turn** (`src/main/diagnose.ts`): cwd=repo, no tools, no
  settings, asks for a strict JSON plan; degrades to null without auth (the raw
  error still shows). Recall happens before any model call.
- Tests: `test/diag-cache.mjs` (signature normalization incl. the module-name-vs-path
  fix, recall/remember, per-project, status) + `test/diagnose-card.mjs` (renders
  repo/host steps, Apply seeds the composer + clears, Dismiss clears). `bun run
  verify` green (25 checks).

## 2026-06-25 — Svelte component prop schema reachable via selection (option D)

- Bug: selecting a rendered Svelte component never showed its prop schema. A
  Svelte component instance compiles to **no DOM node**, so the usage-site
  `data-dsgn-source` stamp on `<Accordion>` is dropped (no `...rest` forwarding) —
  the only stamps reaching the page are the plain host elements *inside each
  component's definition*, which took the host-element (no-schema) path.
- Fix (**option D — same-file definition schema**): when a clicked host element
  resolves into a `.svelte` file that declares props, `inspectSvelteProps` now
  surfaces **that file's own** props (`extractProps` on the same instance script).
  Works for **every component shape** (block-`{#if}`-root, multi-root, etc.) with
  **zero source mutation** — chosen over rest-forwarding (A/B), which can't reach
  the ~46% of a real library that has no single host root. Per-instance editing
  (option C, runtime instance→usage mapping) is the planned follow-up.
- Edits to a definition-scoped prop route to the agent as a prop-default change
  (the instance has no node to splice). The panel surfaces the schema only — no
  misleading live value — and the note is honest ("no per-instance value; editing
  changes the default, affecting only instances that don't set it"). SvelteKit
  route files (`+page`/`+layout`) are excluded (their `data`/`form`/`params` are
  framework-injected, not props). New `test/prop-svelte-self.mjs` (the brief's
  smoke check): definition host → `hasSchema:true` with the right fields, edit →
  agent, plus propless-host and route-file negatives; cross-file path intact.

## 2026-06-25 — Work on a `dsgn/*` branch per project

- Opening a project now puts dsgn's work on a **`dsgn/*` branch** so the user's main
  branch stays clean. `src/main/git.ts` (pure, child_process only): `ensureBranch`
  keeps an existing `dsgn/*` branch or creates `dsgn/<current-branch>` off HEAD
  (`dsgn/work` when detached); `switchBranch` switches/creates a named one
  (coerced to a git-ref-safe `dsgn/<…>`). `checkout -b` carries uncommitted changes
  (nothing lost); a conflicting switch surfaces the error instead of forcing.
- **Only manages the repo TOP LEVEL** (`isRepoRoot`, realpath-compared) — opening a
  subdirectory of a larger repo (a monorepo package, or a fixture inside this repo)
  is a no-op, so the test suite never switches dsgn's own branch.
- The branch shows as a **clickable pill in the titlebar** (`⎇ dsgn/main`); clicking
  opens an inline editor to rename/switch (Enter applies, Esc cancels). The open flow
  logs `Working on branch … (created)` to the activity console.
- `git:ensure`/`git:set` IPC; `useSession.branch`; `BranchResult` contract. Unit test
  `test/git.mjs` (real temp repo: normalize, non-repo no-op, ensure create/keep,
  switch create/existing); chat-render covers the pill + inline editor. `bun run
  verify` green (22 checks); confirmed the suite leaves dsgn on `main`.

## 2026-06-25 — React Native / iOS-Simulator preview (Phase 1: live mirror)

- New preview mode: a booted **iOS Simulator** running an Expo/React Native app
  shown in the right pane instead of a web browser (macOS-only). Phase 1 of a
  phased plan (mirror → interact → element-select); user-chosen scope: RN/Expo
  first, macOS-only, start with a view-only mirror.
- **Frame transport — reuse over reinvention.** Rather than a new renderer canvas
  fed frames over IPC, `src/main/simulator.ts` stands up a tiny local **"sim
  bridge"**: an HTTP server that captures the booted device (`xcrun simctl io …
  screenshot`, JPEG) and serves it as an **MJPEG** behind a one-`<img>` page. The
  renderer points the **existing** preview `WebContentsView` at that URL — so the
  simulator is "just another local URL" and every geometry/load/retry seam
  (`preview:set-bounds`, `preview:load`, the `did-fail-load` retry loop) is reused
  unchanged. Modeled on `serve-sim` (Evan Bacon) and Maestro Studio.
- **Detection** (`devserver.ts`): `detectFramework` recognizes `expo` /
  `react-native` (checked first — Expo repos also list `react-native`); `detect()`
  sets `previewKind: 'web' | 'simulator'` on `DetectedProject`. Frame capture uses
  only `xcrun simctl` (ships with Xcode, zero extra install); `idb` is detected for
  the Phase-2 interaction path but not required.
- **Preflight** (`simulator.preflight()`): all read-only `execFile` probes, never
  throws; returns a human `reason` per failure class (not-macOS / no-Xcode /
  no-runtime / no-device). `App.attempt()` branches on `previewKind`, preflights
  first, and surfaces a clean banner+console card off the happy path instead of
  crashing. Backend teardown is cross-routed (opening a web project stops any
  simulator and vice-versa); `stop()`/`restartPreview()` route by `previewKind`.
- **Lifecycle** (`simulator.start`): boot a device (prefer already-booted, else
  newest iPhone) → `bootstatus` wait → spawn the dev command (default `expo
  run:ios`: build+install+launch+serve) in its own process group → stand up the
  bridge → readiness = first captured frame. `stop()` SIGTERMs the Metro group and
  closes the bridge (sim left booted for fast re-open); `before-quit` cleanup.
- **Preload routing**: the bridge page is flagged `?dsgnSim=1`; `src/preview/
  preload.ts` early-returns its whole web overlay there (no previewed-app DOM to
  stamp/inspect). The "Select" toggle is hidden in sim mode until Phase 3.
- **Contract** (`src/shared/api.ts`): `Framework` += `expo`/`react-native`;
  `PreviewKind`; `DetectedProject.previewKind`; `RunningSimulator`; `SimPreflight`;
  `SetupStrategy` += `babel-plugin-rn` (Phase 3); `DsgnApi.simulator.{preflight,
  start,stop,onLog}` mirrored in the preload.
- **Tests (degrade off-macOS, like agent-e2e):** `sim-detect` (expo/RN→simulator,
  vite→web), `sim-preflight` (non-mac → ok:false + reason), `sim-frame` (exercises
  the whole bridge→MJPEG→WebContentsView transport with a stub frame source via a
  main-process test hook — **no simulator needed**), `sim-e2e` (boots a real sim;
  SKIPs unless macOS + `DSGN_SIM_E2E=1` + `DSGN_SIM_FIXTURE`). `bun run verify`
  green (19 checks; agent-e2e + sim-e2e SKIP here).
- **Not yet verified on-device:** the simctl/expo orchestration in `start()` is
  macOS-only and could not run in this Linux CI env — it needs a Mac with Xcode to
  confirm boot/build/launch end-to-end (the bridge/transport itself IS verified by
  `sim-frame`).

## 2026-06-24 — First-run offer to scaffold `.dsgn/tokens.json`

- When a project opens with **no** design tokens (`tokens.detect` → `source:'none'`
  — no manifest, Tailwind theme, or CSS custom properties), dsgn now offers a
  starter `.dsgn/tokens.json` (colors/spacing/radius/fontSize). Accepting is a
  deterministic file write (no agent turn); the manifest then becomes the
  editable, canonical source the palette reads.
- `scaffoldManifest` (tokens.ts, `tokens:scaffold`) only writes when the project
  has **zero** tokens — it never shadows a live Tailwind/CSS source or clobbers an
  existing manifest (guarded on `detectTokens(...).source === 'none'`, idempotent).
- New `TokenOfferCard`; the offer yields to the setup offer (one card at a time).
  Offer state lives on `useTokens` (`offerNeeded`/`offerDismissed`/`scaffolding`,
  cleared on project switch via `reset()`). New `test/tokens-scaffold.mjs` covers
  the write, idempotency, no-shadow/no-clobber, and the card's accept + dismiss.
- Adversarial review fix: `acceptTokenScaffold` re-checks `projectRoot` after the
  async write resolves (mirrors the detect handler) so switching projects mid-write
  can't stamp the old project's starter palette into the new project's state.

## 2026-06-24 — Svelte inline text-splice in source

- Inline text editing rewrote JSX text directly but punted `.svelte` to the agent.
  Now `applySvelteTextEdit` (props-svelte.ts) splices Svelte text content via
  svelte/compiler — the `.svelte` counterpart of the JSX path, same contract:
  plain-`Text` children + splice-safe new text apply directly; empty / expression
  (`{...}`) / mixed / element children fall back to the agent.
- Mirrors the JSX engine's whitespace handling (lead/trail from the raw source,
  zeroed for all-whitespace) and splice-safety regex (`^[^<>{}]*$`, so the new
  text can't open a tag or mustache). Reuses the shared `findElement` /
  `makeLocator` so line/col match the stamps.
- `props.ts` dispatches `.svelte` to it (was a hard agent-fallback). New
  `test/text-edit-svelte.mjs`: plain `<h1>` text rewritten to `.svelte` source;
  a mixed `<p>Label <Badge/></p>` correctly needs the agent.

## 2026-06-24 — Auto-restart the preview after setup

- A setup turn edits the build config (vite.config / svelte.config), which
  Vite/SvelteKit only read at boot — a page reload alone never applied the new
  source-stamping plugin, so the user had to manually restart. Now dsgn does it.
- `useSetup.busy` already uniquely marks "the setup turn is in progress" (only
  `acceptSetup` sets it), so verification is now armed when that turn **finishes**
  (the `done` handler), not when it's dispatched — closing a race where a
  mid-turn dev-server auto-restart could be mistaken for the verdict.
- On setup `done`: arm `verifying` + raise a one-shot `restartRequested`. App
  consumes it and `restartPreview()` does `devServer.stop()` → `start()` (reusing
  the captured launch spec: root + resolved dev command + framework) →
  `preview.load(newUrl)`. The post-restart readiness report is the verdict. Only
  restarts servers dsgn owns (skips attached). On relaunch failure (a broken
  config edit) it disarms verification and surfaces the error instead of hanging.
- New `test/setup-restart.mjs`: opens a fixture, drives the finished-setup signal,
  asserts the server relaunches, the preview reloads, and the zero-stamp verdict
  fires (no silent success). Also backfilled `verify` to run the setup tests.
- Adversarial review (3 dimensions, independently verified) caught and fixed:
  cancelling a setup turn no longer restarts (an interrupt arrives as `done` with
  `busy` still set — `stop()` now clears it); a project switch mid-restart is
  guarded (re-checks `projectRoot` after each await so it won't relaunch the old
  project over the new one); and an attached (user-owned) server now reports
  "restart it yourself" instead of a false zero-stamp verdict.

## 2026-06-24 — Framework-aware setup (detect before generating)

- Fixed the core setup bug: dsgn assumed React and wrote a Babel JSX plugin
  (`dsgn-source-plugin.cjs`) to the repo **root** of any project — useless in a
  SvelteKit repo (no Babel pass, no JSX) and it would have reported success
  anyway. Setup is now **framework-first**.
- `src/main/setup.ts` `detect()` reads `package.json` deps **first** and branches:
  `@sveltejs/kit`/`svelte` → Svelte (markup-preprocessor strategy, with
  `svelteMajor`), `react`/`@vitejs/plugin-react(-swc)`/`next` → React (Babel
  plugin), `solid-js` → Solid (Babel — also JSX), `vue` → Vue (inspector
  strategy, **no bespoke file** — reuse its ecosystem), else `unknown` → none.
- Artifacts are **scoped to `.dsgn/`** (not the repo root): `.dsgn/dsgn-source.cjs`
  (React/Solid) or `.dsgn/dsgn-svelte-stamp.mjs` (Svelte preprocessor using
  `svelte/compiler`, 1-based line / 0-based col to match `props-svelte.ts`). Both
  are **structurally dev-gated** (`NODE_ENV === 'production'` → empty visitor /
  no-op), idempotent, and removable via a new `setup:uninstall` (also sweeps the
  legacy root plugin).
- `acceptSetup` now builds **framework-correct** agent instructions (React
  `interface Props`, Svelte 5 `$props()` vs Svelte 4 `export let`, Vue
  `defineProps<Props>()`) and **stops with a clear message** for unknown/Vue
  rather than handing React steps to a non-React repo.
- **Verification (no silent success):** `acceptSetup` arms `verifying`; the next
  readiness report confirms stamps fired — `>0` → "Setup verified", `0` → a hard
  warning that the instrumentation didn't fire.
- New `test/setup-detect.mjs`: per-framework detect/scaffold/uninstall, idempotency,
  dev-gating, legacy-cleanup — through real IPC. `ready-gating.mjs` updated to the
  `.dsgn/` path. `SetupResult` reshaped (`framework: Frontend`, `strategy`,
  `svelteMajor`, `files[]`; dropped `pluginFile`).

## 2026-06-24 — Preview runs on its own free port (7777+), bound to 127.0.0.1

- dsgn now **always spawns the dev server on a free port it picks** (first free at/above
  7777) **bound to 127.0.0.1**, via `--port/--host` flags (vite/sveltekit/next) or
  `PORT`/`HOST` env (CRA/unknown). This kills the framework-default collisions
  (5173/3000), the IPv4/IPv6 `localhost` mismatch, and the attach-to-a-stale-server
  confusion in one move — the attach-on-open probe is dropped (always a fresh,
  isolated server).
- **Not 6666:** the IRC ports (6665-6669, 6679, 6697) are on the browser/WHATWG-fetch
  blocked-ports list, so Chromium AND the Node `fetch` readiness probe refuse them —
  a preview there can't load even though the server binds (curl works, which masked it).
  `findFreePort` skips the whole blocked-ports list; base is 7777.
- Readiness now probes the assigned port directly (primary) with the printed-URL parse
  as fallback. `findFreePort`/`isPortFree`/`BLOCKED_PORTS` unit-tested; open-preview
  asserts the preview lands on a port ≥ 7777. `bun run verify` green (13 tests).

## 2026-06-24 — Stop the in-flight agent turn + setup streams progress

- A **Stop** affordance interrupts the running agent turn (`agent.interrupt()` → the
  SDK emits `result`→`done`, clearing `isRunning` and any setup `busy`).
- The on-open **Setup** card now streams its agent turn into the chat (so you can
  watch and stop it) and is guarded: `busy` stays true until the turn finishes
  (cleared by the `done`/`error` handler), a scaffold failure clears `busy`, and
  it won't re-trigger while a turn is running. `verify` green (13 tests).

## 2026-06-24 — Inline text editing

- **Double-click a stamped, text-only element in the preview** (in Select mode) to edit its
  text in place; Enter/blur writes the new text straight to source, Escape cancels.
- Engine (`applyTextEdit` in `props.ts`): finds the JSX element at the stamp, and when its
  children are plain text (a single JSXText, or empty) and the new text is splice-safe
  (`/^[^<>{}]*$/`), rewrites the text child in source preserving leading/trailing whitespace.
  Expression/mixed content (`{title}`, nested elements), self-closing elements, or `.svelte`
  files fall back to the agent (`needsAgent`).
- Wiring: the preview preload drives the inline `contentEditable` edit and emits the commit;
  main relays it (sender-checked) to the renderer, which applies via `text:apply` with the
  current project root (agent-seeds on `needsAgent`).
- `test/text-edit.mjs`: a plain-text `<h1>` is rewritten in source; an expression child
  (`{props.label}`) → agent. ✅ `bun run verify` green.
- **Adversarial review (5 findings, all fixed):** the `editing` flag could strand select mode —
  now `setActive(false)` and `pagehide` end the edit, and a detached node self-heals on the next
  mouse move (HMR mid-edit); a write failure now routes the edit to the agent instead of being
  silently dropped; surrounding whitespace is derived from the raw source (so `&nbsp;` etc. aren't
  rewritten as literal bytes) with the all-whitespace overlap zeroed.

## 2026-06-24 — Activity console (visibility into the open-project flow)

- A collapsible **Activity console** (titlebar "Logs" toggle) shows the whole open
  sequence with timestamps: detect result, attach-vs-spawn decision, raw dev-server
  output, readiness, preview load, agent session start, Ready — and any error
  (errors auto-open it). Docked full-width above the panes; the native preview
  reflows via its ResizeObserver. `useLog` store (capped at 500 lines) +
  `ConsolePanel.tsx`; `App.attempt` emits the step lines, `devserver:log` feeds the
  raw output. Also strips the ANSI codes (so the URL line reads cleanly). This is
  the trail that would've made the lkmv.ch hang obvious at a glance.
- Gave the "Open project" button a `btn--open` class — adding the "Logs" `btn` made
  `.btn` ambiguous and broke the tests' open-click. open-preview now also asserts the
  console captured Detected/Dev server/Preview loaded/Ready. `bun run verify` green (12 tests).

## 2026-06-23 — Readiness gating, floating prop panel, on-open setup

A project that isn't dsgn-ready no longer pretends to be editable — and dsgn offers to fix it.

- **Gating**: prop editing is now gated on a resolved react-docgen schema (`PropInspection.hasSchema`).
  Selecting an element auto-inspects (App effect, race-guarded by source); a schema-backed
  component opens the editor, an unready one (host element / untyped / unstamped) shows a
  prompt-only hint with a "set up the project" link.
- **Floating prop panel** (`PropPanel.tsx`): the editor moved out of the chat to a panel on the
  preview's right edge — component name, source, and every prop with a typed control + its
  description. Because the preview is a *native* view (DOM can't float above it), the panel
  reserves a right-edge strip via `preview.setPanelInset` and the native bounds shrink while
  it's open.
- **On-open setup** (`SetupCard` + `src/main/setup.ts`): the preview preload reports whether
  the app is source-stamped; if not, dsgn posts a chat offer to set it up. Accept → dsgn writes
  the dev-only stamping Babel plugin deterministically, then asks the agent to wire it in and
  type the components (the hybrid).
- New `test/ready-gating.mjs`: scaffold writes the plugin (idempotent), a no-schema element is
  prompt-only (no panel), a schema-backed one opens the panel, and the offer renders.
  ✅ `bun run verify` green (10 tests).
- **Adversarial review (4 findings, all fixed):** dismissing the offer no longer blanks the
  chat (dismiss clears `needed`); the readiness probe re-samples (600/1500/3000ms) so a slow
  SPA isn't falsely flagged; `acceptSetup` is try/finally so busy can't stick; the gating test
  now also asserts the positive panel case. No safety issues in the scaffold or preview-bounds.

## 2026-06-23 — Dev-server: attach-to-running + IPv4/IPv6-safe preview

Fixes "opening a project I already run doesn't work" (hit on lkmv.ch):

- **Attach instead of duplicate.** If the project's dev server is already serving
  (probe the known framework's default port — Vite/SvelteKit 5173, Next/CRA 3000 —
  on both 127.0.0.1 and [::1], require status < 400), dsgn previews THAT instead of
  spawning a competitor. Two dev servers on one project clash (e.g. SvelteKit's
  `.svelte-kit/`) and the duplicate 500s. Only known frameworks attach; 'unknown'
  always spawns (so it never grabs an unrelated app on 5173/3000). Attached servers
  aren't owned, so Stop/quit won't kill them.
- **IPv4/IPv6-safe URLs.** A spawned `vite dev` often binds IPv6-only (`[::1]`) while
  the preview resolves `localhost` to IPv4 (`127.0.0.1`) → blank preview. The runner
  now resolves the printed URL to whichever concrete loopback actually answers and
  loads that.
- **Moved dsgn's own renderer off 5173** (→ 5180) so it stops colliding with every
  Vite/SvelteKit project's default port.
- Extracted pure helpers to `src/main/devserver-net.ts` with a unit test
  (`test/devserver-net.mjs`): host variants, attach policy (unknown → no probe,
  500 → don't attach, IPv6 fallback). `bun run verify` green (11 tests; open-preview
  now serves over 127.0.0.1). Updated tests that hardcoded `localhost`.

## 2026-06-23 — Svelte / SvelteKit support (prop editing → framework-agnostic)

- Prop editing is now **framework-agnostic by dispatch**: `props.ts` routes by
  source extension — `.svelte` → new `src/main/props-svelte.ts`, everything else →
  the unchanged React/JSX engine. Both share helpers (resolveSource, mergeFields,
  withinRoot, isValidAttrName) and return identical PropInspection/PropEditResult.
- `props-svelte.ts` parses with `svelte/compiler` (ESM, dynamic-imported): finds
  the element at line:col, reads literal attributes, resolves a component schema
  cross-file from `export let` (Svelte 4) or `$props()` + `interface Props` (Svelte 5),
  and applies literal edits by splicing the `.svelte` source.
- Added a **Svelte stamping recipe** to `docs/DESIGN.md`. Test
  `test/prop-edit-svelte.mjs` (svelte-app fixture) covers the cross-file `$props` schema,
  literal apply, host attrs, and same-line/column disambiguation.
- **Adversarial review (1 real bug, fixed):** `resolveSource`'s greedy regex parsed
  `"path:line:col"` as `file="path:line", line=col` — a latent bug on the shared path.
  Now non-greedy; plus a defense-in-depth attr-name re-validation in `applySvelteEdit`.

## 2026-06-23 — Design-token detection + palette

- `src/main/tokens.ts` auto-detects a project's design tokens, probing three sources in
  priority order so the right one is chosen per repo: **`.dsgn/tokens.json`** manifest →
  **`tailwind.config.*`** (parsed *statically* with babel — literal theme values only, the
  config is never executed) → **CSS custom properties** (a depth/file-bounded scan of the
  repo's CSS, grouped by name prefix). First source with tokens wins.
- Renderer: tokens load on project open into `useTokens`; the inspector gains a "Tokens"
  toggle showing the detected palette (swatches for colors, the source labeled). Clicking a
  token seeds the chat to apply it to the selected element — reusing the agent path rather
  than a fragile per-framework style editor.
- `test/tokens.mjs` proves the priority (manifest wins over a present Tailwind config) and
  each parser (nested Tailwind colors flatten, CSS `var()` aliases skipped) through real IPC,
  plus the palette UI. ✅ `bun run verify` green (8 tests).
- **Adversarial review (7 verified findings, all fixed):**
  - **Tailwind parser correctness** (the two that justified gating the merge): `theme.extend`
    tokens were dropped whenever a base category also existed (the most common Tailwind
    pattern), and the theme search matched *any* nested `theme:` (a plugin/preset could leak
    bogus tokens). Now scoped to the config's actual export and merges base + extend (extend
    wins). Both locked with fixture regression tests.
  - **Prompt-injection regression**: the token-apply path interpolated raw page-derived
    element fields, bypassing the `oneLine` sanitizer used everywhere else — now routed
    through it (+ bounded token name/value); tested with an injected-newline id.
  - Token detect is guarded against a project-switch race; `isColor` covers named colors /
    gradients (via `CSS.supports`); the palette caps tokens per group; tests cover the
    `source: 'none'` state and the seeded-prompt contract.

## 2026-06-23 — Cross-file prop-schema resolution

- The prop editor now resolves a component's schema even when it's imported from another
  file: if there's no same-file react-docgen match, `props.ts` finds the component's relative
  import in the usage file, resolves the module path (tries `.tsx/.ts/.jsx/.js` + `/index`,
  refusing anything outside the project root), and runs react-docgen on the definition file.
- Matches on the **exported** name from the import (`{ Button as B }` → `Button`), so a
  re-export barrel that also defines another component can't mis-attach its schema
  (flagged + fixed in review). Edits still target the usage site, never the definition.
- `test/prop-edit.mjs` extended: `<Button>` used in `Card.tsx` but defined in `Button.tsx`
  resolves Button's enum/string schema with the live usage value. ✅ `bun run verify` green.

## 2026-06-23 — v3 engineer handoff: annotations + Publish→PR

- **Annotations sidecar** (`src/main/annotations.ts`): reviewer notes pinned to elements,
  stored in `<repo>/.dsgn/annotations.json` (list/add/remove via IPC). The agent is denied
  writes anywhere under `.dsgn/` (a guard in `agent.ts` `canUseTool`), so it can't clobber
  the handoff.
- **Pins**: the preview preload draws numbered pins over annotated elements (located by
  selector, repositioned on scroll/resize/HMR); clicking a pin focuses its note in the panel.
- **Renderer**: `useAnnotations` store; an "Add note" composer in the inspector; a
  `NotesPanel` listing notes (with delete) and a **Publish PR** button. Notes load on open,
  pins stay in sync, both clear on project switch/stop.
- **Publish** (`publishToPr`): creates a branch, commits the working changes + notes, pushes,
  and `gh pr create`s with a generated body (notes as a checklist + changed files). Args go
  through `execFile` (no shell). Common failures (no gh / no remote / nothing to publish) are
  surfaced.
- Test `test/annotations.mjs` drives the flow through real IPC: a note saved via the inspector
  persists to the `.dsgn` sidecar, shows in the panel, and removes cleanly. ✅ `bun run verify`
  green (7 tests).
- **Adversarial review (14 verified findings, all fixed):**
  - **Publish was unsafe** — `git add -A` swept the whole working tree (unrelated WIP /
    untracked secrets) into the PR. Now: pre-flight gates (is-repo, not detached, has origin,
    gh present) before any mutation; stage only tracked changes + the `.dsgn` sidecar
    (`add -u`, no untracked sweep); roll back to the original branch on failure (and report
    where the work landed if already committed); clean changed-file list via
    `diff --name-only HEAD` (no porcelain rename-arrow / quoting bugs).
  - The `.dsgn` guard now also blocks **Bash** commands touching the sidecar (was edit-tools
    only; noted that Auto/bypass mode skips `canUseTool` entirely).
  - Annotation writes are serialized (promise-chain mutex) + atomic (tmp + rename), so
    concurrent add/remove can't lose a note and a crash can't truncate the file.
  - `buildPrBody` extracted to a pure `src/shared/pr-body.ts` with a unit test (escapes
    backticks, caps the file list, flattens newlines).
  - Renderer: a failed note save keeps the text (no silent loss); pin-focus scrolls the note
    into view; publish state resets on project switch; pins build once and only reposition
    (no per-scroll churn); the pin interval is cleared on pagehide.

## 2026-06-23 — Prop/token editor (react-docgen + hybrid apply)

- `src/main/props.ts`: given an element's `data-dsgn-source` ("relpath:line"), parse the
  source file with `@babel/parser`, find the JSX element on that line, read its current
  literal attributes, and run **react-docgen** (FindAllDefinitions resolver) for the
  component's prop schema (types, enums, required, descriptions). Both deps are ESM-only,
  so they're dynamic-`import()`ed like the Agent SDK.
- **Hybrid apply**: simple literal props (string/number/boolean/enum) are written straight
  to source via a targeted string splice (formatting-preserving, no codegen dep) → the dev
  server hot-reloads; non-literal/`other` values return `needsAgent` and the renderer seeds
  the agent instead. Path is hardened: `resolveSource` rejects absolute paths and anything
  resolving outside the project root.
- Renderer: an "Edit props" toggle in the inspector reveals `PropEditor`, which renders
  typed controls (text/number/checkbox/enum-select) from the inspection and applies on
  change/blur; `useSession.projectRoot` carries the root needed to resolve sources.
- Test `test/prop-edit.mjs` drives the engine through real IPC (no dev server/auth):
  inspect resolves the schema + live values, apply writes `variant="warn"` to the fixture,
  and the UI renders the typed rows. ✅ `bun run verify` green; also hardened the
  select-element test's retry budget against load-induced flake.
- **Adversarial review (5 verified findings, all fixed):**
  - **Same-line elements** (`<Badge>` inline in an `<li>`/`<p>`) resolved to the *wrong*
    element — the exact-line match returned the first/outermost. Now column-aware (the stamp
    plugin emits `line:col`) and, without a column, picks the innermost element on the line.
    Regression-tested.
  - **Prop-name injection**: an unvalidated name was spliced raw into source. Names are now
    validated against an attribute-name allowlist at every layer (schema, current attrs, and
    the apply IPC boundary).
  - **Wrong schema** attached to imported child components (the `docs[0]` fallback) — now only
    falls back for an anonymous single component, else shows the "no schema" note.
  - Failed applies are **surfaced** in the editor (and the control resets to the file value)
    instead of silently dropping. `projectRoot` is cleared on project (re)open.

## 2026-06-23 — Permission approve/deny cards + Auto mode (SDK)

- `canUseTool` (main) now drives a real approval flow: for any tool the SDK gates, it emits
  a `permission-request` and awaits the user's decision via a per-session pending map,
  resolving the SDK callback on allow/deny — and denying cleanly on abort / epoch change /
  session replace / quit so a torn-down turn never leaves the SDK blocked. Read-only tools
  (Read/Glob/Grep/LS/NotebookRead) are auto-allowed so "Ask" mode stays usable.
- **Permission-mode selector** in the toolbar → `query.setPermissionMode` live, mode also
  passed at project-open so it sticks: **Ask** (`default`), **Auto-accept edits**
  (`acceptEdits`), **Auto: approve all** (`bypassPermissions`). "Auto" is genuine SDK
  bypass — under it the SDK never calls `canUseTool`, so no cards appear.
- Renderer: `usePermissions` store (mode + pending queue, deduped by id); `PermissionCards`
  renders approve/deny cards above the composer; App routes `permission-request`/`-resolved`
  events. `chat-render` test seeds a card, approves it, and asserts the three modes incl.
  `bypassPermissions`. ✅ `bun run verify` green.
- **Adversarial review (8 verified findings, all fixed):**
  - **`bypassPermissions` needs `allowDangerouslySkipPermissions: true`** in the query options
    or the CLI refuses to bypass — so "Auto" silently still prompted. Added the ack flag
    (only takes effect when the user picks Auto; default stays Ask). `agent-e2e` now opens in
    Auto, which both unblocks the unattended edit and live-verifies real bypass.
  - Switching to a more-permissive mode now **releases prompts already on screen** (drains
    `pending` as allow + emits `permission-resolved`); opening another project clears stale
    cards; `set-permission-mode` awaits the SDK before committing, and the toolbar reverts if
    the SDK refuses. `interrupt` drains pending so cards can't orphan. Status line emits only
    after the abort/epoch gate. Each pending now tracks its tool name (for acceptEdits).

## 2026-06-23 — v2 adversarial review + hardening

- Ran a multi-agent review workflow over the v2 diff (security/IPC, lifecycle, renderer/UX,
  test integrity); 11 verified findings, all fixed:
  - **Untrusted page input**: the previewed page controls every picked-element field.
    `describeSelectionForPrompt` now strips control chars/newlines (an injected
    `data-dsgn-source` can't open a new instruction paragraph), validates `source` to a
    `path:line` shape, and caps lengths (code-point/surrogate-safe); the preload also caps
    every field at capture. Full tool-approval gating is still the tracked roadmap item
    (permission cards) — the auto-approving agent is the real backstop to add next.
  - **Forged picks**: the preload now ignores non-`isTrusted` events, so a hostile page
    can't synthesize a click to inject a pick. The test correspondingly switched to a
    *trusted* `webContents.sendInputEvent` click (more faithful than synthetic dispatch).
  - **Stale selection**: opening another project now disarms select mode + clears the pick
    (was leaking a previous repo's source path into the composer); Escape-cancel clears the
    pick too.
  - **Auth banner** now auto-clears once the agent makes progress (was stuck until manually
    dismissed even after the user fixed auth).
  - **Lifecycle**: overlay re-arm is URL-gated (no crosshair on the "no project" placeholder)
    and `preview:reset` clears `selectModeActive` so main/renderer can't desync.
  - **Dead CSS**: `.btn--active` was shadowed by the later base `.btn` rule (equal
    specificity, source order) — the active toggle never rendered blue. Fixed via
    `.btn.btn--active`; the select test now asserts the active background is blue so it
    can't silently regress.

## 2026-06-23 — v2 first slice: click-to-select → source → chat

- **Select overlay** (`src/preview/preload.ts`): a sandboxed preload injected into the
  preview `WebContentsView`. Shadow-DOM hover highlight + click pick; captures tag,
  short CSS path, `data-dsgn-source` stamp (nearest-ancestor), text, rect, and a curated
  set of computed styles. Escape exits select mode. Built as a second preload entry
  (`electron.vite.config.ts` rollup input → `out/preload/preview.js`).
- **IPC**: renderer → main → preview `preview:set-select-mode`; preview → main → renderer
  `preview:element-picked` / `select-cancelled`, with a sender check so only the preview
  view can emit picks. Select mode is re-armed after each preview navigation.
- **UI**: a "Select" toggle in the titlebar (running only), an `Inspector` card above the
  composer (tag, resolved source or "no stamp" note, style chips), and a one-click
  "Ask dsgn to change this…" that seeds the composer with the element + source reference
  so the agent edits the right place. New `useSelection` store.
- **Convention**: `docs/DESIGN.md` documents the `data-dsgn-source` stamp + a reference
  Vite/Babel plugin (dev-only). Shared `SelectedElement` type so preload + renderer can't
  drift; added `tsconfig.preview.json` so the preview preload is type-checked.
- **Polish — first-run auth onboarding**: `isAuthError` heuristic flips an amber banner
  pointing at `claude setup-token` instead of burying a raw 401 in chat.
- **Tests**: `test/select-element.mjs` drives the full path (open fixture → enable select →
  dispatch a click in the preview webContents → assert inspector + source → assert composer
  hand-off) against a new `selectable-app` fixture; `chat-render` now also asserts the auth
  banner. ✅ `bun run verify` green (smoke, open-preview, chat-render, select-element);
  agent-e2e SKIPs cleanly without creds. Artifacts `06`/`07`/`08`.

## 2026-06-23 — Logging, cross-machine handoff, self-testing

- Added `CLAUDE.md` + `docs/{CONTEXT,PROGRESS,TASKS}.md` so progress/context/tasks
  live in-repo and travel via git (continue on any machine after `git pull`).
- Added `test/agent-e2e.mjs`: a REAL Claude turn that opens an editable fixture,
  asks the agent to change a heading, and asserts the file changed. SKIPs without
  auth, FAILs if the turn ran but didn't edit. Added `bun run verify`.
- ✅ Ran `bun run verify` with credentials present: **AGENT-E2E OK** — the agent
  edited the fixture via a live turn. Confirms end-to-end agent works and the SDK
  CLI subprocess spawns correctly inside Electron (prior runtime risk resolved).

## 2026-06-23 — Adversarial review fixes

- Ran a multi-agent review workflow (15 verified findings); fixed: session
  epoch-guard (no stale events across project switches), composer-stuck-on-switch,
  `sandbox:true` on main + preview windows, preview hardening (window-open handler +
  will-navigate origin pin + validate `preview:load` is local http(s)), per-outage
  retry reset, resize-drag release on blur/visibilitychange, `/` menu Escape re-arm,
  CSP `object-src`/`base-uri`.

## 2026-06-22/23 — Chat upgrade + controls + UX

- Markdown rendering (react-markdown + remark-gfm + rehype-highlight, hand-written
  hljs theme, plain CSS).
- Composer toolbar: model picker (live `setModel`), thinking/effort selector,
  `/` skill menu from the SDK init `slash_commands`.
- Drag-to-resize split (hides native preview during drag). Custom dev-command
  escape hatch on launch failure; Reload/Stop controls.

## 2026-06-22 — Real Agent SDK chat

- Wired `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` (ESM, dynamic import): persistent
  multi-turn `query()`, cwd=repo, `settingSources` + `claude_code` preset,
  streaming deltas + tool status over IPC, `canUseTool` auto-approve.
- Fixed ESM-in-CJS crash; preview readiness polling + retry for `ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE`;
  dev-server ownership + cleanup-on-quit + conflict errors.

## 2026-06-22 — Scaffold + preview + tests

- electron-vite + React + TS shell; two-pane layout; native `WebContentsView`
  preview with IPC geometry sync; typed `window.api`; dev-server runner
  (detect/spawn/parse/readiness). Playwright+Electron smoke + open→preview tests.
- Made dsgn its own git repo (was an untracked subdir of `~/.git`).
