/**
 * On-disk store for user-added model endpoints (v10 "connections" — see
 * `ProviderConnection`). Unlike sessions-store's file-per-record layout, every
 * connection lives in ONE `<baseDir>/providers.json`: there are a handful of them,
 * they're always read together (the picker needs all of them to build its groups),
 * and a whole-file rewrite of ~1KB is cheaper than a directory walk on every
 * `choices()` call. Writes go through a tmp+rename so a crash mid-write can't
 * leave a half-file — with a single file that would cost the user EVERY connection,
 * which is exactly the failure sessions-store dodges by sharding.
 *
 * `baseDir` is injected (the app passes the same `<userData>/trezi` dir agent.ts
 * uses); tests point it at a temp dir. So is the `SecretCipher` — that keeps
 * `electron.safeStorage` out of this module entirely, so the whole thing is a pure
 * unit test with a fake cipher (see test/providers-store.mjs).
 *
 * KEY DISCIPLINE: the encrypted key blob lives only in the on-disk record and is
 * never part of `ProviderConnection`. `list()`/`get()` return the renderer-safe
 * shape (`hasKey` only); `secretFor()` is the single door to plaintext and is
 * main-only. A key is never written unencrypted — if the platform has no keyring,
 * `save()` throws rather than degrading to plaintext.
