 * paths, ipcMain) or the network; everything testable without them lives next door.
 *
 * Three jobs:
 *  1. Own the store singleton + the `safeStorage` cipher, so a key is encrypted at

 *  2. Probe an endpoint's `/models` (the settings dialog's "Connect" button) —

 *  3. Build the chat picker's `ModelChoice[]`: main is now the single source of
 *     truth for which models exist, so the renderer never hardcodes a list again.
 *
 * KEY DISCIPLINE (see providers-store.ts): plaintext keys never cross IPC and
 * never enter a log line or an error string — the one door to a key is
 * `secretFor()`, used only by main-process catalog, chat and Jev requests.
