 * One-time move of the pre-rename `.dsgn/` DATA files into `.praxis/` so
 * annotations/tokens made before the 2026-07 dsgn→praxis rename survive. Only
 * files Praxis owns move; the old stamping helpers stay put because the repo's
 * own build config may still reference them (setup uninstall removes them).
 * Called on every project open (project:detect) — a no-op once migrated.
 * Pure (fs only, no electron) so it's unit-testable.
