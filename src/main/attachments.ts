/**
 * On-disk home for images the user pastes into the composer.
 *
 * An image DROPPED from Finder already has a path (`webUtils.getPathForFile`),
 * so the renderer can hand that one to the agent as-is. An image PASTED from the
 * clipboard is an in-memory blob with no path at all — it reaches the model as a
 * vision block and nothing more, so the agent can see the screenshot but has no
 * file to copy into the repo and ends up asking the user "where is this saved?".
 * Writing those bytes into the app's own attachments dir gives every shared
 * image a path, which is the whole point of this module.
 *
 * Pure (fs + path only, no electron) so it's unit-testable; the caller injects
 * the directory (main uses `<userData>/trezi/attachments`) and the timestamp.
 *
 * Everything here is renderer-supplied and therefore untrusted: the media type
 * picks the extension from a fixed table, the suggested name is reduced to a
 * safe basename, and nothing is ever written outside `dir`.
