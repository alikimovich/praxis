 *
 * The SDK keeps `findCodexPath()` private, so this re-derives it: the same triple
 * map, the same `vendor/<triple>/…` layout, both the current (`bin/codex`) and
 * legacy (`codex/codex`) shapes. Every step is best-effort and falls through to
 * plain `codex` on PATH — a wrong guess costs a failed probe and the
 * cached/last-resort list, never a broken turn.
