/**
 * Per-CHAT git-worktree isolation (v9). Generalizes the comment-spawn worktree
 * machinery (`worktrees.ts`) to interactive chats: every chat on a git repo root
 * runs in its own long-lived `dsgn/chat-<id>` worktree, and after each completed
 * agent turn its work auto-merges back onto the LIVE checkout so the preview (which
 * always serves the live tree) updates between turns. On mid-turn drift the turn
 * parks on the branch for review instead of clobbering the user's edit.
 *
 * Pure (child_process + git + fs via worktrees.ts, no electron) so it's unit-testable
 * against temp repos. The Electron glue lives in `chat-isolation.ts`.
 *
 * Base-advance contract: git-state operations that MUST re-point the fork point
 * (`syncFromLive`) mutate `wt.baseSha` in place; turn/apply operations return the new
 * base as `newBase` and let the caller (`chat-isolation.ts`) own the mutation, so the
 * advance only happens on a successful merge/apply.
