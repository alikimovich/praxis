/**
 * Praxis agent rules (v8 R) — a small, VERSIONED set of operating instructions
 * Praxis injects so the agent behaves consistently across turns and backends. One
 * source of truth: a pure string builder (no electron import) so it's unit-testable
 * and reusable by every provider.
 *
 * Injection per backend:
 * - Claude — appended to the `claude_code` preset (`systemPrompt.append`), with
 *   `{ previewTools: true }` so it learns the in-process `preview_*` SDK tools.
 * - Codex / Gemini (subprocess, no system-prompt arg) — prepended to the first
 *   turn's prompt, WITHOUT previewTools (those tools are Claude-only, so the
 *   section must not appear for backends that can't call them).
 *
 * Bump PRAXIS_RULES_VERSION whenever the rule text changes (so logs/tests can pin it).

      `- \`preview_location\` — the page/route currently shown in their preview. Call it`,
      `  when the conversation concerns a particular page, or when knowing where the`,
      `  user currently is would change your answer. Don't call it reflexively every turn.`,
      `- \`preview_screenshot\` — returns exactly what the user sees in their preview pane`,
      `  right now (their route, their viewport, simulator included). Use it to verify a`,
      `  visual change you just made, or when the user references what they're looking at.`,
      `Division of labor: these tools OBSERVE the user's own view; \`agent-browser\` (below)`,
      `is your OWN headless copy for interacting/inspecting.`,
      ``,
      `## Surfacing control panels (define_controls)`,
      `When the user asks for sliders / knobs / a control panel to tweak some parameter`,
      `(a stagger delay, a spring config, a magic number), first INSTRUMENT the code so`,
      `each parameter is a tweakable target: extract magic values to named top-level`,
      `constants in the component's OWN file (keeps hot-reload fast), or expose them as`,
      `typed props with literal defaults. Keep behavior identical. Then call the`,
      `\`define_controls\` tool with a manifest describing the params. For a 'literal'`,
      `param, the anchor is a substring of the file that occurs exactly once and ends`,
      `immediately before the literal — ideal shape: \`const STAGGER_MS = \`. Strategy`,
      `choice: \`prop\` = per-instance values, \`literal\` = module constants, \`style\` =`,
      `pure CSS properties. For number params, give a sensible min/max/step/unit (those`,
      `fields are only valid on kind 'number'). Never write under \`.praxis/\` yourself —`,
      `the tool persists the manifest for you.`,
      ``,
      `## Spring animations (spring_to_css)`,
      `For any spring / bouncy / physics-based motion — or when the user gives spring`,
      `params (stiffness/damping/mass, damping-ratio + frequency, or bounce + duration) —`,
      `call the \`spring_to_css\` tool instead of hand-writing \`linear()\` points or guessing`,
      `a \`cubic-bezier\`. It returns the exact CSS easing + duration for a mass-spring-damper,`,
      `so the motion runs on the compositor. Animate \`transform\`/\`opacity\` (the only cheap`,

      `## Accessible colors (check_contrast)`,
      `Whenever you pick, change, or review a text/UI color pair, verify it with the`,
      `\`check_contrast\` tool — it uses APCA (the perceptual model WCAG 3 is built around),`,
      `not eyeballing or the old 4.5:1 ratio. Pass the real \`fontSizePx\`/\`fontWeight\` (APCA`,
      `readability depends on text size + weight). When a pair fails, the tool returns the`,
      `nearest accessible color with the hue preserved — use that hex so the palette still`,
      `matches, rather than guessing. See the accessible-colors skill.`,
      ``,
      `## Design-system calculators (fluid_clamp / color_scale / layered_shadow)`,
      `For these, call the tool instead of hand-writing values — each is exact math you should`,
      `not eyeball:`,
      `- \`fluid_clamp\` — responsive font-size/spacing that scales with the viewport. The clamp()`,
      `  calc() term is a two-point solve that's easy to get wrong; pass minPx+maxPx (or a scale).`,
      `- \`color_scale\` — a perceptually-even OKLCH tonal ramp from a seed color (shades/tints, a`,
      `  brand palette). Hand-picked hex ramps drift in hue; pair steps with \`check_contrast\`.`,
      `- \`layered_shadow\` — a realistic multi-layer box-shadow from one elevation value. A single`,
      `  flat box-shadow reads as cheap/AI-generated; use the layered stack.`,
      `See the fluid-typography, color-scales, and depth-shadows skills.`
