/**
 * Per-turn commits on the LIVE checkout.
 *
 * A chat's work is committed on its own `trezi/chat-<id>` worktree branch, but the
 * merge back onto the live tree is a plain file WRITE (`autoApplyWorktree`) — so
 * without this the user's own checkout just accumulated one giant uncommitted diff
 * until Publish. That makes a single turn impossible to review or roll back with git.
 * After every turn that actually changed something, `commitLiveTurn` lands those exact
 * files as one commit on whatever branch the live checkout is on, so `git log` reads as
 * the session's progress and any turn can be undone with `git revert`.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow, because this writes into the user's repo:
 *  - only the files the turn itself touched are staged (never `add -A`), so concurrent
 *    hand edits elsewhere stay uncommitted and a revert can't take them with it;
 *  - the commit is a PATHSPEC (partial) commit, so anything the user had staged for
 *    their own commit is left staged and untouched;
 *  - the trezi-managed `.trezi/` sidecar is never committed (same rule as
 *    `commitWorktree`);
 *  - only inside a git repo ROOT — for a subdirectory project, committing would sweep
 *    up the enclosing repo, which is exactly the surprise `isRepoRoot` exists to avoid;
 *  - best-effort: any git failure (mid-merge partial commit, hooks, missing identity)
 *    returns `committed: false` and never throws. A failed commit just leaves the
 *    change in the working tree, i.e. the behavior before this existed.
 *
 * Pure (child_process + git only, no electron) so it's unit-testable against temp repos.
