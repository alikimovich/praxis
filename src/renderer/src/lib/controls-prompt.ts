 * The "Surface controls with AI" trigger prompt (Custom Controls, v10) — a real
 * auto-sent agent turn, like the setup offer's second half. The instrument-first
 * workflow is spelled out here because only the Claude backend carries the
 * `define_controls` tool (whose schema documents the manifest shape); the other
 * backends get the props-based fallback the Props tab can pick up. Element-
 * derived fields are page-sourced (semi-trusted) → collapsed through oneLine,
 * same as every other selection-seeded prompt.
